This class uses team-based learning for part or all of the semester.  By working in teams, students will:

* Learn to work and communicate with others who may have different backgrounds or working styles from themselves (as in the real-world)
* Learn to delegate and split up responsibilities and tasks
* Better understand where they can add value with their individual talents and abilities
* Learn to compromise and resolve conflicts that may arise in the midst of the team project (these are common and to be expected)

The following group work rules and expectations are provided to the class at the beginning of each team project to help clarify each students’ role and responsibility in the team project.

## Team Formation

* Teams (of 2-3 individuals) will be formed by instructor based on a number of factors, including backgrounds, meeting availability, experience levels and learning styles of each team member.
* In some cases (I will let you know when), an individual may choose to work alone with the permission of the instructor - however, you may miss out on collaborative learning opportunities.

## Team Leadership Roles

* Each team member will be asked to choose his or her own leadership role for one or more components of the group project at the beginning of the project.
* By signing on to a leadership role, you’re taking ultimate responsibility for that component of the assignment.  This means making sure tasks are delegated appropriately, the assignment is completed according to the requirements and the assignment is properly turned in.  It does not mean that the leader should do the assignment component completely alone - this is a sign of poor leadership and cooperation.
* Leadership roles will be determined in the Group Project Management assignment in class.
* Each team member's’ performance in his or her leadership role will be a core component of the peer evaluation conducted at the end of the semester.

## Team Processes and Procedures

* Teams should agree on a common meeting time and agree on what each member should have done before the meeting.  Teams should make reasonable accommodations for meeting times around work and class schedules, however, all team members must make an effort to be available for meetings.
* In some cases, it may be beneficial for team members to collaborate virtually, using tools like Blackboard Learn, Skype, Google Drive, Dropbox or Slack.
* The leader for the current assignment component should take responsibility for coordinating these meetings and delegating tasks/deadlines.
* Assignments are handed in as a team - that means if an assignment is late, the whole team is affected.
* Teams may choose to assign someone in addition to the team lead to monitor that the assignment is correct and double-checks it before it is handed in.
* If the leader for the assignment is going to be absent or unavailable on the assignment due date, it is his or her responsibility to make sure someone turns it in.

## Conflicts and Resolutions

* If a team member refuses to cooperate on an assignment, his/her name should not be included on the completed work.
* If the problem persists, the team should meet with the instructor so that the problem can be resolved, if possible.
* If the problem still continues, the cooperating team members may notify the uncooperative member in writing that he/she is in danger of being fired, CCing the instructor.
* If there is no improvement, the team should notify the individual (in writing - CCing the instructor) that he/she is no longer with the team.
* The fired student should meet with his/her instructor to discuss options.  
Students who get fired or quit must (a) find another team willing to add them as a member, (b) work and submit assignments individually for the rest of the semester or (c) get zeroes for the remaining assignments.

## Team Self and Group Evaluation

* Midway through the project, teams will be asked to evaluate the success of their team and team members so far.  These evaluations present the opportunity for teams to deal with and resolve any conflicts early in the project.
* Teams will also submit a formal evaluation and peer review at the end of the project.  This evaluation will be given to the instructor and will be used in determining each individual’s final grade (see class syllabus for details on grading).
* Individuals will be evaluated based on their ability to responsibly complete and turn in work and cooperate with other team members.  Team members won’t be evaluated based on relative skills or academic ability.  Final evaluations will not be shared with individual group members -- only the instructor.
