2.  Open the command line interface (called Terminal on the Mac)
3.  Type "sudo gem install sass" and enter

## Starting Up Grunt Again

If you've exited the Terminal app, you'll need to do the following first:

1.  Open the command line interface (called Terminal on the Mac)
2.  Navigate to the directory where your project is located.  If your project is located in the Documents folder on your computer, you would type: "cd Documents/PROJECTNAME/httpdocs" and enter.
3.  Type "grunt" and hit enter.

Grunt will stay running as long as you keep the terminal window open.  

To end Grunt, use Control (not command) + C.
