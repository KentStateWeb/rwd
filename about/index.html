	<h1>About RWD</h1>
	<section class="main-content-area">
				<p class="section-introduction">In 2010, Ethan Marcotte published his famous article on A List Apart called <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</a>. The article was quickly followed by the <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design Book</a>, published by A Book Apart in 2011. In this book, Marcotte popularized the idea of using flexible grids and CSS media queries to build a single website that scales across mobile phones, tablets, desktop computers, televisions and everything in between.</p>
				<p>Since then, Responsive Web Design has become not just a technical solution for web design - itâ€™s an entire process that brings multiple disciplines together to form one product that works across multiple devices. The responsive design process includes user experience, content strategy, information architecture, visual design, HTML/CSS/JavaScript development, usability testing and technical testing.</p>
				<h2>RWD at Kent State</h2>
				<p>Kent State University's Responsive Web Design classes were designed with the goal of bringing together students from multiple disciplines from within the <a href="http://www.kent.edu/cci">College of Communication and Information</a> and giving them the skills they need to work with and become web designers.  The classes are hands-on and encourage active learning.  The class is constantly evolving, always integrating the latest advancements in design, development and user experience design.</p>
				<p>We've made this information public with the hope that others will find it helpful when creating similar programs at their educational institutions.</p>
		<h2>Instructor: Christopher Hallahan</h2>
		<p>I work full time for Kent State's <a href="http://www.kent.edu/cci">College of Communication &amp; Information (CCI)</a> as a User Experience Designer at the college and <a href="http://www.ideabasekent.com">IdeaBase</a>, a collaborative, student-run agency located in Downtown Kent, where we conduct research, design and development work for real-world clients, both inside and outside the university.</p>
		<p>My degrees are both from Kent State University - a bachelor's degree (2008) in Electronic Media (School of Journalism and Mass Communication) and master's degree (2010) in User Experience Design (School of Library & Information Science).</p>

		<p>David Roll joined the SLIS faculty in fall 2015 as a joint appointment with the School of Visual Communication Design. He earned his combined BS/MA degree from the Kent State University VCD program in 2007 and has worked as a graphic designer/art director and part-time instructor since. Before coming back to Kent State, David worked as a designer for The Discovery Channel in Silver Spring, MD and Epstein Design Partners in Cleveland, Ohio on a range of projects from print design and branding to interactive, motion,UI design and environmental graphics.
