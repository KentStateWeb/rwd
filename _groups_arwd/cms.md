description: "Content Content Management System team is responsible for the final technical architecture that users will interact with, via the CMS.  They’ll also work closely on items that require more advanced database or dynamic functionality, including JavaScript.  This team will ultimately define the content structure and types in the CMS, building out HTML templates, CSS (SASS) and JavaScript that has been technically tested and takes performance and accessibility into account.  The CMS team will work closely with the content/UX team to ensure appropriate content types are developed and that those content types are intuitive for CMS users to input content.  They’ll also work closely with the visual design team, taking completed design patterns and integrating them into the final templates via HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  The CMS team will ultimately tie everything together for the public release."
