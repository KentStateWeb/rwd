The User Experience (UX) team is responsible for advocating for all functionality related to how users interact with the product and the goals and user flows that drive them.  This includes testing and getting feedback from actual end-users of the product.  They will be particularly immersed in developing and refining content, requesting content from stakeholders (by way of the account manager).   The UX team is responsible for documenting how the content must be developed to speak to their users.

**Collaboration**

* The User Experience team must work directly with visual designers to ensure design elements are derived from real content and all design interactions make sense for the users.  
* They must also be in continual contact with the CMS team, ensuring the appropriate content types are built out in the CMS and the CMS architecture accurately represents the flows and needs of the end user.   Additionally the UX team is responsible for building out the final content (including media, photos, text) into the CMS for release.

**Milestones**

These milestones will be assigned weekly and must be completed by the end of the semester.  Individually, you'll be graded on the milestones that you personally work toward, claim and successfully complete.  You'll respond to each milestone via the sprint survey (see assignments).
