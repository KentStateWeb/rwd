description: "The Visual Design team is responsible for the visual design patterns as well as the general design language to be utilized for the product.  While the design team may sketch and wireframe concepts in static design programs, design patterns must ultimately be developed into responsive design patterns that are in working condition.  Additionally, by the end of the product, a library of design patterns and language used in the website will be developed.  The Visual Design team must collaborate closely with the UX team to ensure appropriate patterns are being designed to accomplish user goals.  Additionally, the patterns should incorporate real content that has been developed and written by the UX team.  They visual design team must also collaborate with the CMS team, ensuring their design patterns are properly integrated into the CMS and that the patterns ultimately work together to establish a cohesive design in the final website."
