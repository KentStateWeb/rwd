## The Setup

* You're an employee at a small web design shop and have just gotten one of your first clients - a small website project for their business.
* Your boss has assigned you and another colleage to the project.  You are both equally responsible for development, design and content strategy.
* The client is launching their business in January, so they need most of the design/development done and approved before then.
* They plan to put the site into a content management system - but they need a working style guide and prototype in order to effectively implement it.
* They have an onsite employee who will be maintaining and improving the website after the project is finished.

*Note: In this scenario, I will play the client and the business, while based on some actual businesses, will be fictional*

## Project Goals

Why this type of project?  This allows you, the student, to apply what you're learning in class to a real-world scenario.  By thinking critically and using these principles, you're developing long-lasting development and design skills that can be used to land you a job or complement your existing areas of expertise.

## Project Groups

You'll work in pairs on this project (except for one group, which will be 3 people).  Each pair will work on a slightly different (but largely equivalent) web project.  The projects are as follows:

<ul>
{% for groups in site.groups %}
	  {% include groups.html %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>


## Project Schedule

You and your boss have worked together to develop a brief project schedule - based on her previous experience.  She knows this may need to be adjusted, but it's a good starting point.


### 1: Kickoff Meeting and Research

* Meet with the client and determine project goals, design aesthetic, etc.
* Communicate why investing in a responsive website makes sense for their business.
* Understand the types of content needed
* Communicate the project schedule
* Get a list of competitors in preparation for doing a brief competitive analysis.
* Put together a project in GitHub that will house all future project deliverables so that they're easy to access by the client.

###  2: Content & Architecture

* Collect any existing content that the client has provided
* Reformat and rewrite that content using a mobile-first methodology
* Ask the client for any missing content
* Put together a sitemap in Google Docs

###  3: Sketching

* Based on your content, you'll develop a few, mobile-first sketches to show the client
* The sketches will show some of the main templates that you'll be developing.  You may choose to show them at different breakpoints.
* Using the sketches, you'll identify the repeatable patterns present in your design

###  4:  Style Tiles/Personality

* Using the goals you discovered in your client meeting, you'll develop 2 sets of style tiles that show the colors, design aesthetic and personality of the website.
* You'll show these to the "client" in class, and the class will ask questions.

###  5:  HTML Content Wireframes

* You'll begin putting together the content you gathered into an HTML template structure
* You'll prioritize the most important content up top
* The content wireframes will demonstrate to the client how the site will respond at different breakpoints.

###  6:  HTML/CSS Final Prototype/Templates

* Using your content templates, you'll begin to add CSS styling to your CSS
* You'll create some repeatable template elements using Jekyll
* You'll determine how each repeatable element looks and functions

###  7:  Technical and Usability Testing

* You'll test your prototypes with some real users, having them perform some simple tasks
* You'll see how the site renders on different browsers and devices, and make adjustments.
* You'll run performance tests to see how you can optimize and improve your prototype

### 8:  HTML/CSS Style Guide and Patterns

* Based on your final prototypes, you'll develop a pattern library that demonstrates the typography, colors and primary atomic elements used in the design
* You'll include documentation on how to use these elements
* You'll include some guidelines for content, such as voice and personality

### 9:  Project Timeline, Presentation & Critiques

* You'll invite the client in for a hands-on walkthrough of the final prototype
* You'll show a retrospective of what you did to get to this point
* The class will participate, asking questions and making suggestions
* The class will evaluate the success of your design based on the client's initial goals

### 10:  Group and Self Assessment

* Your boss wants to know how you think the project went and what you could do better.
* You'll evaluate yourself and your team member.
* You'll submit your final prototype, style guide and project timeline.
