A maximum of 4 unannounced quizzes will be given during class.  Here are the rules:

* Quizzes will be given on the assigned readings for that class (listed on the schedule).  Questions may be open-ended or multiple choice.
* Each quiz will be 1 or 2 questions, at 1 point each.
* If you aren't present for a quiz, you won't be able to take the quiz and will get a 0.  If you have a university-approved absence, you may take a make-up quiz, which will be equivalent, but different questions.
