You've received content for a conference website and would like to begin structuring it in HTML.  Using the markup skills you've learned so far (text, lists and links), structure the plain text content into a webpage using CodePen.  Don't worry about presentation for this assignment.  

This is an individual assignment, and it will be turned in via Blackboard Learn.

Your completed assignment should look <a href="/img/html1.png">something like this</a>.  

**Do not copy and paste another student's code.  If I catch you doing so, you'll receive a 0 for the assignment.**

## What To Do

1. Set up a [CodePen](http://www.codepen.io) account (in class).
2. Create a new **public pen** and name it using this structure: "Your Last Name - HTML Basics 1".
3. Take the plain text content (provided below) and structure it into HTML in your pen.  You must use semantic headings to indicate hierarchy.  Links must be functional.  Lists should be formatted as unordered or ordered lists.   Pay attention to the client notes - they're important.
4. CodePen automatically inserts all of the required code for the HEAD of the document (the html, body and title tags).  Add in the Viewport meta tag to make the site behave responsively on mobile devices. (Settings > HTML > Insert the most common viewport meta tag)
6. Once you're satisfied, go to Choose a View > Full Page > Copy the Live URL (View > Debug is also acceptable.  Pretty much the same thing).
7. View your newly completed website as a web page on different devices.  Does everything render correctly?
8. After you've completed your testing, log in to Blackboard Learn to submit your assignment.  Go to Assignments > Assignment Name.  Under Write Submission, Paste both the URL of the Pen (Editor Mode).  Click Submit.

Enduring Trauma?

Poynter KSU Media Ethics Workshop 2015

***(Client note - ^ these are the most important things on the page)***

About the Conference
Covering trauma -- a tragic accident, a horrendous attack, a sickening court case, a catastrophic weather event – exposes journalists and victims to complicated questions about ethics and responsibility. This year’s Poynter KSU Media Ethics Workshop will delve into significant topics including privacy, re-victimization and the trauma that journalists themselves often deny. Best practices for PR and other media professionals also will be covered.

The Poynter KSU Media Ethics Workshop is a one-day training program for professionals, educators and students that examines critical issues and perspectives in media ethics. Moderated by distinguished ethics faculty from The Poynter Institute, the Media Ethics Workshop provides a unique forum for professionals and students alike to confront and discuss significant issues crucial to understanding media ethics and its effect on our world. Previous Workshops have addressed online ethics, sports media ethics, political media ethics, entertainment media ethics and the ethics of data mining. Established in 2004, the Poynter KSU Media Ethics Workshop continues its mission to strengthen media credibility and bolster citizens’ faith in media integrity.

## Rubric

Use the following rubric to ensure you receive the highest possible grade for the assignment:

* **3-4**: HTML is structured appropriately.  Headings show hierarchy, links are functional, paragraphs are tagged appropriately and lists are marked up correctly.  The client's notes were followed and the appropriate links were posted to Learn.
* **2**: The HTML is mostly structured correctly, but there are some syntax errors (tags are not closed or inappropriate tags are used).  Some of the client's notes were missed.
* **0 - 1**: HTML does not use appropriate tags for the types of content.  Few tags are formatted appropriately, client notes were missed and the pen was not set up or submitted according to instructions.
