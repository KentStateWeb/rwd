It's time to start developing the structure of your website and entering placeholders for some of the content!  Before we start building in full force, we need to first wireframe the structure of our various components and pages.  This is in preparation for the three templates that you'll turn in at the end of the class.  All work from here on out will contribute directly to the final version of your project.

## What To Do

You've already sketched out your site on paper and developed a lot of the core content.  Now we need to start developing your content into HTML wireframes.  The wireframes will be built mobile-first and demonstrate the content priority in each of your 3 templates.

Remember, the wireframes don't need to be "pretty" yet.  We're going to create the structure first, and then slowly add style and layout (including responsive breakpoints) to our templates through CSS.

1.  Create a new folder in your project repository and call it "wireframes".  
2.  Inside the folder, create three individual HTML files.  One is going to be called index.html (which will be your home page template).  The other two are your choice, depending on which 2 other templates are most important for your website.  For example, a Product page might be considered a template.  You don't have to create a separate template for each Product, since they will all follow the same basic format.
3. Create a structure for each of the HTML pages, based on your content.  Most of your sites will include a header and footer.  The rest of the content elements are up to you.  Don't forget to add the required HTML DOCTYPE code in the HTML files.
4. Use semantic HTML to mark up your content.  For example, you might surround your main content using the MAIN HTML template and the header using the HEADER tag.  Some elements will be surround by DIVs with class names (for example, a DIV called "menu-item").
5. If your site uses navigation, mark it up using an unordered list.  We'll style it to look like a menu later.
6. Add real content into your 3 templates.  The content should be representative of the actual content that will be on the website, not lorem ipsum.  Links need not work right now.  You can link to a "#" if the link is not available.
7. Once you have created your three templates, create a new file called "style.css".  This is where your styles will eventually go.
8. Link your stylesheet to each of your main templates, using the code below. 
9. Add a few default styles to make your templates a bit easier to view.  Use the CSS below.

## How to Turn In the Assignment

You'll be submitting the style tiles to your project repository on GitHub as three HTML files.

1.  Save the three HTML files according to the directions above.  They should be in a subdirectory called "wireframes".
2.  On your root index.html file, which is the Project Hub, add an H2 with Date: Wireframes.
3.  Add a link to the three HTML templates/wireframes under your Wireframes section.  The links should be something like "wireframes/index.html".
4.  After you've commited and synced your changes via GitHub Desktop, you can submit both the timeline hyperlink and the link to the three live wireframe HTML files via Blackboard Learn.  Note: Don't link to the local version on your computer.  You need to access the live version on the web with the GitHub.io URL.

Your wireframes might look something like <a href="http://rwdkent.com/wireframes/index.html">these wireframes, used to create the RWD website</a>.

## Rubric

Use the following rubric to ensure you receive the highest possible grade for the assignment:

* **4 - 5**: Your wireframes demonstrate the content that will be displayed on your website.  The wireframes use correctly written HTML, and the HTML uses semantic HTML5 elements when necessary.  You correctly linked the stylesheet and added the default styles.  Your three HTML files were commited to the reposistory correctly and linked from your Project Hub.
* **2 - 3**: You created three wireframes, but the HTML is not always correctly written.  Content may not be added into the wireframes.  You linked the stylesheet correctly. 
* **0 - 1**: You may be missing one or more of the wireframes, and the HTML is poorly structured.  Your key content is not demonstrated in the wireframes.  You may have not followed directions correctly or linked the default stylesheet.
