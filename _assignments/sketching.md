The best way to start visualizing your project is by sketching on paper.  Sketches are meant to be rough and imperfect.  They should allow you visualize how your content might fit together and be prioritized for your templates.  They'll also allow you to begin picking out components (patterns) that will be present in all of your templates. 

This is a team project.  Your team repository should have your sketches posted on the due date.

## What To Do

Now that you have identified project goals, main content and reviewed similar websites, you and your partner should sketch out at least 3 variations of your client's website on paper.  Sketches should include the following:

1.  Name of the template or type of content being sketched.  For example, a product page.
2.  Annotations to describe different elements on the page.
3.  Mobile-First thought processes.  Your sketches should assume a smaller screen size and content should be prioritized accordingly.  However, you can include versions of the sketches that depict a larger screen format.
4.  On a separate piece of paper (or in the margin of your sketches), list out the "components" that you anticipate needing to design.  Components are the individual elements or pieces that make up the page.  A component might be header, footer, navigation bar, menu item, a staff bio, etc.

You won't be graded on how "pretty" the sketches look - just on the amount of thinking that went into them, and how effectively they communicate the solution.  

## How to Turn In the Assignment

You'll be submitting the sketches as image or PDF files to your project repositiy on GitHub, just like the last assignment.  

1.  Create a new folder (subdirectory) within your site called "sketches".
2.  Take photos of your various sketches with a phone.  Get those files onto the computer via email or other means.  Now, place those photos in the "sketches" directory of your GitHub repository.
3.  On your root index.html file, which is the Project Timeline, H2 with Date: Sketches.
6.  Add a link to your sketch images under the H2.  The links should point to researchsketches/mysketch.jpg, for example.
7.  After you've commited and synced your changes via GitHub Desktop, you can submit both the timeline hyperlink and the link to the sketches documents via Blackboard Learn.  Note: Don't link to the local version on your computer.  You need to access the live version on the web with the GitHub.io URL.

## Rubric

Use the following rubric to ensure you receive the highest possible grade for the assignment:

* **4 - 5**: Your annotated sketches depict at least 3 main templates.  The templates are appropriate for the type of content that will be displayed on your website. The templates were approached from a mobile-first perspective and uploaded correctly to the project repository.
* **2 - 3**: You completed the 3 sketches, but they lack detail or are not completely appropriate for the type of content on the website.  You may have approached from a large screen perspective.  
* **0 - 1**: You're missing 1 or more sketches, and the sketches are not detailed.  They may not have been submitted correctly to the repository.
