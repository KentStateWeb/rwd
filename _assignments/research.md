Any good web project should start with just enough research, and this one is no different.

This is a team project.  Your team repository should have your research posted on the due date.

## What To Do

On the day the project is assigned, you would have met with the client to determine project goals and design aesthetics.

Because of time, we're not going to do actual client meetings.  I've provided the answers to common client questions on <a href="/class/groups/">your project pages</a>. After reviewing these answers, visit 3 websites that are similar to your client's website and take some notes on things like:

* Common Navigation
* Content Voice and Tone
* Design Aesthetic
* Layout

After conducting your competitive analysis, develop a short document that communicates the following:

* Top goals for the website, as determined by the research
* List of the content that is needed for the website, organized under sections (not necessarily separate pages, although they could be).  This is the start of your navigation.
* List of the types of templates/layouts that you may need, based on this content.  For example, a home page, contact page, products page, and calendar page.  Not every page has its own template, for example the individual products pages all use the same basic template.
* List a short analysis of the most common themes you notice from competitive websites, including common navigation, content voice and tone, design aesthetic and layout.  You might note what is most common across all of the sites, and what is different across the sites.

You can use whatever program you'd like to write this assignment.  You do NOT have to write it in HTML (unless you really want to).

## How to Turn In the Assignment

Since this is the first assignment, we will need to create a GitHub repository to house and host the project files.  We will create a GitHub repository and accounts in class.  When creating the repository in class, you will need to note your repository login information.

After creating your repository:

1.  Create a new folder (subdirectory) within your site called "research".
2.  Output a PDF file with the contents of your research and place it in the "research" directory.
3.  Create a new index.html file within the root of your website folder (if there is not one there already.  You probably created on in class already).
4.  Add the required DOCTYPE information to the HTML file.  You can use <a href="https://gist.github.com/challahan/0f8d805423259882cbc2">this template</a> (also embedded below).
4.  On your root index.html file, add an H1 called Project Timeline and afterward, an H2 with Date: Research/Competitive Analysis.
6.  Add a link to your Research PDF file under the H2.  The link point to research/YOURPDFFILE.pdf.
7.  After you've commited and synced your changes via GitHub Desktop, you can submit both the timeline hyperlink and the link to the research document (PDF) via Blackboard Learn.  Note: Don't link to the local version on your computer.  You need to access the live version on the web with the GitHub.io URL.  It should be something like: http://rwd-test.github.io/sample-project.  Only one person needs to submit the files to the repository and Blackboard Learn, since this is a group assignment.

## Rubric

Use the following rubric to ensure you receive the highest possible grade for the assignment:

* **4 - 5**: Your research contains a thoughtful analysis of all of the required parts, and matches the goals you heard from the client.  You submitted your assignment correctly via GitHub and created the correct files/links.  
* **2 - 3**: Your research contains some of the required parts, but it could be more detailed and thoughtful.  You submitted the assignment correctly via GitHub and created the correct files/links.
* **0 - 1**: Your research is missing some of the requried components completely.  It may have not been turned in to the repository according to directions.
