Any good web project should start with just enough research, and this one is no different.

This is a team project.  Your team repository should have your research posted on the due date.

## What To Do

On the day the project is assigned, meet with the "client" and determine project goals, design aesthetic using the following questions:

1.  What are your top goals as a business this year?
2.  What would you like the website to be able to do for your users?
3.  Who are some of your top competitors?
4.  If you could use a few adjectives to describe your company and desired website, what would they be?

After your client meeting, visit 3 websites that are similar to your client's website and take some notes on things like:

* Common Navigation
* Content Voice and Tone
* Design Aesthetic
* Layout

After conducting your competitive analysis, develop a short document that communicates the following:

* Top goals for the website, as determined by the research
* List of the content that is needed for the website, organized under sections (not necessarily separate pages, although they could be)
* List of the types of templates/layouts that you may need, based on this content.  For example, a home page, contact page, products page, and calendar page.
* List a short analysis of the most common themes you notice from competitive websites, including common navigation, content voice and tone, design aesthetic and layout.  You might note what is most common across all of the sites, and what is different across the sites.

## How to Turn In the Assignment

Since this is the first assignment, we will need to create a GitHub repository to house and host the project files.  We will create a GitHub repository and accounts in class.  When creating the repository in class, you will need to note your repository login information.

After creating your repository:

1.  Create a new folder (subdirectory) within your site called "research".
2.  Output a PDF file with the contents of your research and place it in the "research" directory.
3.  Create a new index.html file within the root of your website folder.
4.  Add the required DOCTYPE information to the HTML file.  You can use <a href="https://gist.github.com/challahan/0f8d805423259882cbc2">this template</a> (also embedded below).
4.  On your root index.html file, add an H1 called Project Timeline and afterward, an H2 with Date: Research/Competitive Analysis.
6.  Add a link to your Research PDF file under the H2.  The link point to research/YOURPDFFILE.pdf.
7.  After you've commited and synced your changes via GitHub Desktop, you can submit both the timeline hyperlink and the link to the research document (PDF) via Blackboard Learn.  Note: Don't link to the local version on your computer.  You need to access the live version on the web with the GitHub.io URL.  It should be something like: http://rwd-test.github.io/sample-project

## Rubric

Use the following rubric to ensure you receive the highest possible grade for the assignment:

* **4 - 5**: Your research contains a thoughtful analysis of all of the required parts, and matches the goals you heard from the client.  You submitted your assignment correctly via GitHub and created the correct files/links.  
* **2 - 3**: Your research contains some of the required parts, but it could be more detailed and thoughtful.  You submitted the assignment correctly via GitHub and created the correct files/links.
* **0 - 1**: Your research is missing some of the requried components completely.  It may have not been turned in to the repository according to directions.
