Content drives your website's design and your design, in turn, drives your content.  While we can't expect to have all of the content formatted and written before the website is designed, we need to have a starting point.  In this assignment, you'll take some existing content, edit it and format it to work on a website.  The content will eventually make its way into the website templates, where you'll edit it to better fit the design.

This is a team project.  Your content should be posted to your team repository on the due date.

## What To Do

Lets take some of the content your client has provided and begin organizing it and editing it to better fit the mobile-first methodology.

You can find your client's provided content on your [group project page](/class/groups). It might be provided content as Word or image files.


1.  What content will go on the home page of your website?  Remember, the home page's primary goal is typically to drive traffic to other content on your site and allow the user to quickly understand where they are and what they can do.  Some sites do away with the traditional home page entirely, and instead present all of the content on single, long-scrolling page.  Essentially though, even these formats are split into sections that can be shown in a sitemap.  Create a document that has some content ideas for the home page.

2.  Now, take the content your client has provided and separate it into sections/pages, according to your sitemap.  Organize the content according to these best practices: a.) Most important content goes near the top.  Supplemental (less important) content goes near the bottom.  b.) Content answers the top questions a visitor might have (based on your already defined goals).  Unnecessary information is removed (yes, you have the power to remove content if it doesn't match your goals!).  c.) Pages have clear, meaningful headings and sections are broken up by additional headings (H2, H3, H4 etc.) d.) Long paragraphs are avoided.  Instead, content is broken up by bullet points and links to more information. e.) Content maintains a consistent voice in tone that matches the brand.  Wordiness and jargon are avoided to maintain accessibility to all visitors.

3.  Identify missing content.  List the missing content as highlighted text so that your client can easily spot it.  While we won't be completing all of the information on the website for this project, this is still good practice.

4.  Images and files are content too.  You can place the images and files you'll need to display on the website right along with the content in the same folder.

## How To Organize the Content

While there are many ways to organize and edit your content, my favorite way is by creating a shared [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com) folder.  

Inside that folder, you can place your content in individual subfolders that match your site's architecture.  This makes it simple for the client to visualize when reviewing the content.

See an [example from my website](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0ByszO_oMfCZuQU1hN2xnYm9PeEk).

Why not add the content directly into the website?  At this stage, Google Docs is a more maleable tool.  Once the content is put into the website, you may be less likely to make large changes, and may be more preoccupied with the design or code.  Google Docs allows us to view the content independently.

Once you've created your folder in Google Drive, you need to make it publicly accessible.  Click the Share button on the folder and check the option to make it viewable to anyone with the link (no KENT.EDU sign-in required).  Copy the publicly sharable link.

## How to Turn In the Assignment

You'll be submitting the content to your project repository on GitHub, just like the last assignment.  

1.  Create a publicly shareable Google Drive link that points to your content.
2.  On your root index.html file, which is the Project Hub, add an H2 with Date: Content.
3.  Add a link to your Google folder under the H2.  You might link the words "View Website Content".  There's nothing else to upload to your site for this assignment, since it is in Google Drive.
4.  After you've committed and synced your changes via GitHub Desktop, you can submit both the timeline hyperlink and the link to the Google folder via Blackboard Learn.  Note: Don't link to the local version on your computer.  You need to access the live version on the web with the GitHub.io URL.

**Did you remember to make your Google Folder public?**

## Rubric

Use the following rubric to ensure you receive the highest possible grade for the assignment:

* **4 - 5**: Your content is structured into sections/folders according to your architecture.  The content has been edited according to the standards above, with extraneous information removed, bullets, and headings.  You identified what was missing.  Everything was submitted according to directions using Google Drive and GitHub.
* **2 - 3**: You organized the content into sections, but the sections don't always match your website goals.  The content has been edited, but its structure could be improved. The content was submitted according to directions.
* **0 - 1**: Content has not been organized into a logical architecture.  The content was very lightly or not at all edited according to web best practices and does not show thoughtfulness.  The content does not reflect your website's goals.  Your assignment wasn't submitted according to directions.
