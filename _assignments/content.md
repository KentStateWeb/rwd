Content drives your website's design and your design, in turn, drives your content.  While we can't expect to have all of the content formatted and written before the website is designed, we need to have a starting point.

Additionally, one way to start visualizing your content's structure is by sketching on paper.  Sketches are meant to be rough and imperfect.  They should allow you visualize how your content might fit together and be prioritized for your templates.

This is a team project.  Your content and sketches should be posted to your team repository on the due date.

## Content Exercise

Lets take some of the content your client has provided and begin organizing it and editing it to better fit the mobile-first methodology.

You can find your client's provided content on your [group project page](/class/groups). It might be provided content as Word or image files.

### Edit the Content

1.  What content will go on the home page of your website?  Remember, the home page's primary goal is typically to drive traffic to other content on your site and allow the user to quickly understand where they are and what they can do.

2.  Identify missing content.  List the missing content as highlighted text so that your client can easily spot it.

3.  Take the existing content your client has provided and separate it into sections/pages, according to your sitemap.  Organize the content according to these best practices:

* Most important content goes near the top.  Supplemental (less important) content goes near the bottom.
* Content answers the top questions a visitor might have (based on your already defined goals).  
* Unnecessary information is removed
* Pages have clear, meaningful headings and sections are broken up by additional headings
* Long paragraphs are avoided.  Instead, content is broken up by bullet points and links to more information
* Content maintains a consistent voice in tone that matches the brand.
Images and files are content too.  You can place the images and files you'll need to display on the website right along with the content in the same folder.


### Organize the Content

While there are many ways to organize and edit your content, my favorite way is by creating a shared [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com) folder.  

Inside that folder, you can place your content in individual subfolders that match your site's architecture. See an [example from my website](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0ByszO_oMfCZuQU1hN2xnYm9PeEk).

Why not add the content directly into the website?  At this stage, Google Docs is a more malleable tool.  Once the content is put into the website, you may be less likely to make large changes.

### Graduate Students Only: Site Map

In addition to organizing your content into folders on Google Drive, produce a visual document that shows a blueprint of how the content will be organized, with both your primary navigation and secondary navigation/elements underneath each item.  I will show you examples in class.

## Sketching Exercise

You and your partner should sketch out at least 3 "templates" from your client's website on paper based on the most important sections of your website.  For example, a Home, Product and News template. Sketches should include the following:

1.  Name of the template or type of content being sketched.  For example, a product page.
2.  Annotations to describe different content elements (patterns) being displayed on the page.
3.  Mobile-first thought processes.  Your sketches should assume a smaller screen size and content should be prioritized accordingly.  However, you should also include versions of the sketches that depict a larger screen format.  So, 3 templates, but 6 sketches total to show a small and large screen variation.

You won't be graded on how "pretty" the sketches look - just on the amount of thinking that went into them, and how effectively they communicate the solution.

## How to Turn In the Content

You'll be submitting the content and sketches to your project repository on GitHub, just like the last assignment.  

1.  Create a publicly shareable Google Drive link that points to your content.
2.  On your root index.html file, which is the Project Hub, add an H2 with Date: Content.
3.  Add a link to your Google folder under the heading.  You might link the words "Content" and "Sketches"  There's nothing else to upload to your site for this assignment, since it is in Google Drive.
4.  After you've committed and synced your changes via GitHub Desktop, you can submit both the timeline hyperlink and the link to the Google folder via Blackboard Learn.

**Did you remember to make your Google Folder public?**

## How to Turn in the Sketches
You'll be submitting the sketches as image or PDF files to your project repository on GitHub, just like the last assignment.  

1.  Create a new folder (subdirectory) within your site called "sketches".
2.  Take photos of your various sketches with a phone.  Get those files onto the computer via email or other means.  Now, place those photos in the "sketches" directory of your GitHub repository.
3.  On your root index.html file, which is the Project Timeline, H2 with Date: Sketches.
6.  Add a link to your sketch images under the heading.  The links should point to researchsketches/mysketch.jpg, for example.
7.  After you've committed and synced your changes via GitHub Desktop, you can submit both the timeline hyperlink and the link to the sketches documents via Blackboard Learn.

## Rubric

Use the following rubric to ensure you receive the highest possible grade for the assignment:

* **4 - 5**: Your content is structured into sections/folders according to your architecture.  The content has been edited according to the standards above, with extraneous information removed, bullets, and headings.  You identified what was missing.  Your annotated sketches depict at least 3 main templates at a large and small screen size.  Everything was submitted according to directions using Google Drive and GitHub.
* **2 - 3**: You organized the content into sections, but the sections don't always match your website goals.  The content has been edited, but its structure could be improved. The content was submitted according to directions.  You completed the 3 sketches, but they lack detail or are not completely appropriate for the type of content on the website.  You may have approached from a large screen perspective.  
* **0 - 1**: Content has not been organized into a logical architecture.  The content was very lightly or not at all edited according to web best practices and does not show thoughtfulness.  The content does not reflect your website's goals.  Your assignment wasn't submitted according to directions.  You're missing 1 or more sketches, and the sketches are not detailed.  They may not have been submitted correctly to the repository.
