This mini exam will act as our "midterm".  It will encompass all of the basic technical principles behind HTML and CSS.

We will continue to have class in addition to the midterm.

## Purpose of Exam

The purpose of the exam is to evaluate you on some very basic principles of HTML, CSS and responsive web designed learned in the first 6 weeks of class.  If you know these basic principles, you'll have demonstrated that you understand how the web works and are ready to begin developing your own basic web sites.  

## Format of Exam

* Written, with fill-in-the-blank, short answer and multiple choice
* 10 questions (1 point each, 10% of final class grade)
* 30 minutes long
* While you may be asked for small code examples, you won't have to produce any working code.
