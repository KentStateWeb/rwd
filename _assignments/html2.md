You've been tasked with creating a landing page for Kent State's Destination Kent State program.  Using the content and instructions below, create this webpage on CodePen using sementic markup.  Do not worry about presentation for this assignment.

This is an individual assignment, and it will be turned in via Blackboard Learn.  

**Do not copy and paste another student's code.  If I catch you doing so, you'll receive a 0 for the assignment.**

## What To Do

1. Create a new **public pen** and name it using this structure: "Your Last Name - HTML Basics 2".
2. Take the plain text content (provided below) and structure it into HTML in your pen.  As before, you must use semantic headings to indicate hierarchy.  Lines must be properly indented.  Pay attention to the client notes - they're important.
3. All images must have alt text for accessibility
4. When creating an image with a caption, use the figure and figcaption tags.
5. Tables must include a header row and be set up in a proper grid format.
6. YouTube videos should be embedded as an iframe.
7. When creating the contact information, use definition lists to connect the labels (for example, Phone) to the corresponding content (for example, Phone Number).
8. Quotations should be marked up in proper blockquote and cite tags.
9. Before the YouTube video, add an HTML comment that has the link to the YouTube video so that you can find it later if you need to.  Use proper HTML comment syntax.  Remember that HTML comments are only there for you, the developer, and do not display to the end-user.

### Submitting the Assignment
1. CodePen automatically inserts all of the required code for the HEAD of the document.  Add in the Viewport meta tag to make the site behave responsively on mobile devices. (Settings > HTML > Insert the most common viewport meta tag) 
2. Once you're satisfied, go to Choose a View > Full Page > Copy the Live URL. 
3. View your newly completed website as a web page on different devices.  Does everything render correctly? 
4. After you've completed your testing, log in to Blackboard Learn to submit your assignment.  Go to Assignments > Assignment Name.  Under Write Submission, Paste both the URL of the Pen (Editor Mode) as well as the Full View  URL.  Click Submit.

## Rubric

Use the following rubric to ensure you receive the highest possible grade for the assignment:

* **4 - 5**: HTML is structured appropriately and with proper indentation.  Headings show hierarchy, links are functional, paragraphs are tagged appropriately, image and tables are marked up properly.  The client's notes were followed along with the 11 steps and the appropriate links were posted to Learn.
* **2 - 3**: The HTML is mostly structured correctly, but there are some syntax errors (tags are not closed or inappropriate tags are used).  Images are not appropriate size.  Some of the client's notes were missed.
* **0 - 1**: HTML does not use appropriate tags for the types of content.  Few tags are formatted appropriately, client notes were missed and the pen was not set up or submitted according to instructions.
