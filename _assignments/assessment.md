Since this project was a collaborative assignment, I want to hear from each group member about the work ethic and participation of his or her partner.  Just as importantly, though, I want to hear your evaluation of how you felt you performed during the project.  Both evaluations will be used to calculate your assessment grade, and it is possible that group members will have different points awarded.

The survey must be completed by the date of finals, December 18, 2015 @ 5:00 p.m.

## Survey Questions

Group Name:

### Partner and Project Evaluation Questions

Give me some feedback about your partner(s) and how you worked together.  Your answers will NOT be shared with your partner(s) - only me.

1.  Rate how well you and your partner collaborated together on the semester project. (1 - 5).

2.  Rate the quality of your partner's contribution to the project assignments. (1 - 5).

3.  Rate how well you think the project turned out (1 - 5).

4.  Give me some feedback on how you and your partner worked together.  Is there anything I should know when determining your grades?  (Open Ended)

5.  Was your project successful?  Give me some reasons why or why not (Open Ended).


### Self Evaluation Questions

Now it's time to reflect on your performance during the project.  

1.  Rate how well you felt you performed on and contributed to the project ( 1- 5).

2.  What are some things that you did well? (Open Ended)

3.  What are some things that you could have done better? (Open Ended)


## How to Turn In the Assignment

There is nothing to submit for this assignment other than the above survey.

## Rubric

Use the following rubric to ensure you receive the highest possible grade for the assignment:

* **4-5**: After reviewing both you and your partners' evaluations, it is clear that you made every effort to work well together.  Your partner felt you made positive contributions to the project.  You felt that you did the best you could, and your project reflects this quality.  You've shown willingness to reflect on what you could have done better.
* **2-3**: You and your partner could have taken some steps to work better together.  Your partner felt that they had to pick up some of the slack to complete the project, and while you contributed, you could have done more.  You thought of some things you could do better, but didn't provide a lot of detail.
* **0-1**: It's clear from reviewing both of your evaluations that you did not contribute much or at all to the end project, or you did not fill out an evaluation at all.  You didn't show a willingness to reflect on what you could have done better.
