Since this project was a collaborative assignment, I want to hear from each group member about the work ethic and participation of his or her partner.  Just as importantly, though, I want to hear your evaluation of how you felt you performed during the project.  Both evaluations will be used to calculate your assessment grade, and it is possible that group members will have different points awarded.

The survey must be completed by Thursday of finals week at 5 p.m.

## Survey Questions

My name is:

I worked on the following team:

### Partner and Project Evaluation Questions

Give me some feedback about your partner(s) and how you worked together.  Your answers will NOT be shared with your partner(s) - only me.

1.  My team member(s) and I collaborated successfully on this project. (1 - 5).

2.  Overall, the project was a success. (1 - 5).

3.  All team members contributed about equally to the final product.(1 - 5).

4.  Rate the performance of each person in your group on the following scale. This is a comprehensive metric that can include a number of elements, such as quality of work produced, attendance at team meetings, ability to meet deadlines, carrying out assigned responsibilities, taking leadership roles, and so forth.   It is not a rating of their design or development expertise. (1 - 5)

5.  Give me some feedback on how you and your partner(s) worked together. Is there anything I should know when determining your grades? (Open-Ended)

6.  Was your project a success?  Give some reasons why or why not. (Open-Ended)

7.  OPTIONAL: What are some ways (if any) that the instructor could motivate teams to work together more effectively? (Open-Ended)


### Self Evaluation Questions

Now it's time to reflect on your performance during the project.  

1.  How would you rate your own performance throughout the group semester project? ( 1- 5).

2.  What are some things that you did well? (Open-Ended)

3.  What are some things that you could have done better? (Open-Ended)

4.  If given the choice, would you have chosen to work on the semester project individually over working in a group? (Open-Ended)

5.  If given the choice, would the chance to have chosen your own partner(s) resulted in a better experience during the semester project? (Open-Ended)

6.  OPTIONAL: Do you have any comments or feedback about the Fall 2015 Responsive Web Design course in general?  Please note that this response will not be confidential - your response and name will be shared with me, the instructor. (Open-Ended)

## Rubric

Use the following rubric to ensure you receive the highest possible grade for the assignment:

* **4-5**: After reviewing both you and your partners' evaluations, it is clear that you made every effort to work well together.  Your partner felt you made positive contributions to the project.  You felt that you did the best you could, and your project reflects this quality.  You've shown willingness to reflect on what you could have done better.
* **2-3**: You and your partner could have taken some steps to work better together.  Your partner felt that they had to pick up some of the slack to complete the project, and while you contributed, you could have done more.  You thought of some things you could do better, but didn't provide a lot of detail.
* **0-1**: It's clear from reviewing both of your evaluations that you did not contribute much or at all to the end project, or you did not fill out an evaluation at all.  You didn't show a willingness to reflect on what you could have done better.
