Since this project was a complex assignment, I want to hear feedback from each group/individual member.  Evaluations will be used to calculate your assessment grade, and it is possible that group team members will have different points awarded.

The survey must be completed by Thursday of finals week at 5 p.m.

## Survey Questions

I worked on the following team:

Did you work alone or in a group on the project?

### Partner and Project Evaluation Questions

Group Project Evaluation Questions:  Give me some feedback about your partner(s) and how you worked together. Your answers will NOT be shared with your partner(s) - only me.

1.  My team member(s) and I completed project deliverables that were high quality.

2.  My team members(s) and I completed project deliverables on time.

3.  All team members contributed about equally to the final product.

4.  Overall, the project reflects our initial goals.

5.  Rate the performance of each person in your group (not yourself) on the following scale. This can include a number of elements, such as quality of work produced, attendance at team meetings, ability to meet deadlines, carrying out assigned responsibilities, taking leadership roles, and so forth.   It is not a rating of their design or development expertise.

6.  Give me some feedback on how you and your partner(s) worked together. Is there anything I should know when determining your grades?

7.  OPTIONAL: What are some ways (if any) that the instructor could motivate teams to work together more effectively? (Open-Ended)

### Single Partner Project Evaluation Questions

1. I completed project deliverables that were high quality.

2. I completed project deliverables on time.

3. Overall, the project reflects my initial goals.


### Self Evaluation Questions

Reflect on your own performance during the project.

1.  How would you rate your own performance throughout the group semester project?

2.  What are some things that you did well? (Open-Ended)

3.  What are some things that you could have done better? (Open-Ended)

4.  If given the choice, would you have chosen to work on the semester project individually over working in a group? (Open-Ended)

5.  OPTIONAL: Do you have any comments or feedback about the Responsive Web Design course in general?  Please note that this response will not be confidential - your response and name will be shared with me, the instructor.   You will also have the opportunity to provide anonymous feedback in the official course evaluation.

## Rubric

Use the following rubric to ensure you receive the highest possible grade for the assignment:

* **3-4**: After reviewing both you and your partners' evaluations (if applicable), it is clear that you made every effort to work well together.  Your partner felt you made positive contributions to the project.  You felt that you did the best you could, and your project reflects this quality.  You've shown willingness to reflect on what you could have done better.  If individual, you felt you did a great job managing and delivering on your project goals.
* **2**: You and your partner could have taken some steps to work better together.  Your partner felt that they had to pick up some of the slack to complete the project, and while you contributed, you could have done more.  You thought of some things you could do better, but didn't provide a lot of detail.  If working alone, you felt that you could have done a better job managing the project and delivering high quality items.
* **0-1**: It's clear from reviewing both of your evaluations that you did not contribute much or at all to the end project, or you did not fill out an evaluation at all.  You didn't show a willingness to reflect on what you could have done better.  If working alone, you felt that the project deliverables fell well below your expectations.
