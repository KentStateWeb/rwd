As you begin building your templates/prototype, you'll need to think about how real people will use and interact with them (usability), how they perform on  various browsers and devices (technical testing) and how accessible they are to all users (accessibility).  This testing plan will help you validate some of these concerns.

We will run through your testing plan in class on the due date, but your usability tasks should be prepared and your sites should be in working shape before the testing begins in class.

## Assignment Template

In order to make preparing your tasks and collecting results easier, I've prepared a template for you in Google Sheets.  You can copy and use this template for your final assignment (although you can feel free to modify it as needed).

### Usability Plan

First, we need to consider the top goals for your website.  Then, we'll develop some actionable tasks that you can test with real users based on your goals.  Your goals and tasks can be listed in a Google Doc.

1.  Develop and write down 3 of your website's top goals.  You may have defined many of these already in your previous assignments.  A goal is something like "Allow a customer to quickly find our hours of operation".

2.  Based on each goal, create a task that a user will be able to complete using your website templates.  Note:  It's okay that your website is not complete yet.  You can test much of the functionality even when the website is not complete.  In fact, it's better to test early.  A task is typically scenario based and is something like "It's Saturday night around 8 and you'd like to see if Business Name is still open.  Find the answer using the website."  Tasks should frame real-life scenarios that your users might encounter and should not lead them directly to the answer.

3.  On the day of testing, find a group to test your website.  One person will act as the facilitator while another group member or members(s) will take notes and record observations.

4.  Based on the results, summarize your notes into 4 recommendations for improvement or changes.


### Technical Testing Plan

Unlike usability testing, technical testing resolves around the technology.  When developing your testing plan:

1.  In your Google sheet, list your 3 template pages that make up your prototype.

2.  In each column of your spreadsheet, list the following browsers and devices, which you'll test:  Internet Explorer (PC), Safari (Mac), Chrome (PC), Firefox (Mac), Mobile Safari (iOS) and Chrome (Android).

3.  When conducting your tests, you'll note whether each task passed/failed and any applicable notes.  You're looking for any visual problems or technical issues that you encounter while completing the tasks.

4.  On the day of our testing, you're going to run a few performance/speed tests to identify ways to improve your website's speed.  You're going to note the results on the spreadsheet as well.  Run a test at [http://webpagetest.org](http://webpagetest.org) and [https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/).

5.  On the day of testing, note the following results:  Google Page Speed - Mobile Score and Desktop Score.  Web Page Test - Load Time (First View), Start Render Time (First View), Bytes In (Fully Loaded).

Note:  Your performance results will not impact your grade in any way at this time.  It's just a benchmark from which you can make improvements.


### Accessibility Testing Plan

This will be done on the day of testing.  

1.  Run through the Web Accessibility Checklist at http://a11yproject.com/checklist.html and ensure your website has the applicable landmark roles, etc. and make fixes.  You can likely skip the Forms part.

2.  Record any changes you made to make your website meet these requirements.

Note:  Simply following this checklist does not ensure your website is compliant, but it's a good starting point.  The only way to truly test accessibility is to have real participants with disabilities test the site.


## How to Turn In the Assignment

You'll be submitting the links to your Google Sheet (made publicly viewable) in your project repository.  Remember that you should use <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/kent.edu/spreadsheets/d/1cj8GdaVCttFxcbRQqckyU3X1SF-XetH4U9EHWElagiA/edit?usp=sharing">this template</a> to format your results.  The content will be filled in on the date of testing in class.

1.  Create a publicly shareable Google Drive link that points to your testing results from (a) Usability testing summary + tasks, (b) Technical Testing and (c) Accessibility Testing.  Don't forget to make your links publicly accessible!
2.  On your root index.html file, which is the Project Hub, add an H2 with Date: Usability and Technical Testing.
3.  After you've committed and synced your changes via GitHub Desktop, you can submit both the timeline hyperlink and the link to the Google folder via Blackboard Learn.  Note: Don't link to the local version on your computer.  You need to access the live version on the web with the GitHub.io URL.

## Rubric

Use the following rubric to ensure you receive the highest possible grade for the assignment:

* **4-5**: Your usability tasks match your website's goals, and show that you put some thought into them.  They match real-world scenarios and don't lead the user directly to the answer.  You created a technical and accessibility testing plan in a Google Spreadsheet that follows the directions.  Finally, on the day of testing in class, you participated in the testing and completely filled out your testing documents.
* **2-3**: Usability tasks are complete, but could have been better thought out to match user goals.  Your technical and accessibility testing spreadsheet is missing some of the content.  Your group may have not fully completed testing in class.
* **0-1**: Usability tasks show little thought and are too leading.  Your technical and accessibility testing plan is missing more than one key parts.  You or your partner may have missed class completely and did not complete the testing in class.
