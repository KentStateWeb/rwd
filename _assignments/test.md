This mini exam will act as our "midterm".  It will encompass all of the basic technical principles behind HTML and CSS.  

The closed book/computer exam will be written - meaning you won't have to write working code on the spot.  However, you may be asked to write down some code examples as answers.  

##Topics include:

* Basic HTML Markup and Tags
* Images in HTML
* Basic CSS Properties and Usage
* Responsive Design Principles (Media Queries)
* Basic Layout Principles (Flexbox and Grids)

A detailed list of study examples will be given the week prior to the exam.
