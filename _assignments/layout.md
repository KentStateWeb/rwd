We're returning back to our Welcome Weekend website!  We have a good HTML structure in place as well as our basic CSS Styles, but now it's time to make sure the website uses space efficiently while at the same time displaying well on all screen sizes.  

This is an individual assignment, and it will be turned in via Blackboard Learn.  

**Do not copy and paste another student's code.  If I catch you doing so, you'll receive a 0 for the assignment.**

## What To Do

1. Open your HTML Basics 2 assignment.  Instead of editing the original pen, click the "Fork" option at the top.  Click Settings and rename the forked pen using this structure: "Your Last Name - Layout/Media Queries".

It should look [something like this](/img/layout-screenshot.jpg).



26. Once you're satisfied, go to Choose a View > Full Page > Copy the Live URL. 
27. View your newly completed website as a web page on different devices.  Does everything render correctly?  Your final product should look something [close to this](/img/css2-assignment-screenshot.png).
28. After you've completed your testing, log in to Blackboard Learn to submit your assignment.  Go to Assignments > Assignment Name.  Under Write Submission, Paste both the URL of the Pen (Editor Mode) as well as the Full View  URL.  Click Submit.

## Rubric

Use the following rubric to ensure you receive the highest possible grade for the assignment:

* **4 - 5**: CSS is written appropriately and with proper indentation.  All steps were followed and correct styles are applied.  Styles are added efficiently, for example, multiple H1 styles are grouped together, as opposed to separate styles for everything.  
* **2 - 3**: CSS is mostly structured correctly, but there are some syntax issues (for example, you forgot to close a rule with a semicolon.  Some of the steps were missed.  Similar styles are not grouped together.
* **0 - 1**: CSS does not use appropriate style attributes.  Syntax is incorrect and many of the steps were missed. The pen was not set up or submitted according to instructions.
