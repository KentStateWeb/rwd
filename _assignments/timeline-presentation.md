We're almost done!  Now that you've developed template prototypes and a pattern library, it's time to do a final review with your "client" and the class.  There won't be any slides or reports to turn in - you'll only be showing your project timeline, prototypes and style guide.

The review sessions will take place in class on finals week.

## What To Do

Here's what you'll review with the class/client during your review session.  Each review should take about 20 minutes.

1.  Bring up your Project Hub.  This will be the main "presentation".
2.  Briefly review the history of the project, starting from the research assignment.  Be sure to touch on the main goals you identified for the website.  Discuss each part briefly.
3.  Show the three templates and discuss each of them.  Demonstrate how the design changes at different breakpoints.  Discuss any decisions you had to make.
4.  Show your components together in the pattern library, and briefly discuss each of those components.
5.  Discuss any next steps.  What would you have done with more time?  What still remains to be decided?
6.  Ask for feedback and questions from the class/"client".  Note - I may ask some questions during your review, just like a client might do.

## Style Guide

You've been developing your sites' templates using a variety of components that make up the website as a whole.  Lets take a step back and document the primary elements and styles used in your website.  

Why create a pattern library? We need to communicate our design choices to anyone else who may be managing or editing the site once we're gone.  A pattern library serves as a great reference for your client or other developers who want to look up fonts, color values, or code examples.

Pattern Libraries can be very simple or very complex (see MailChimp).  They may also include a style guide component, which discusses things like voice & tone, messaging, etc.  We're going to keep ours simple.

## What To Do

It's helpful to view our site both as a whole and also via its atomic components/patterns (as we learned when studying Brad Frost's Atomic Design methodology).  The components that make up your site can be repeated across many different templates for consistency.  A component might be as simple as a heading, or as complex as a header or primary navigation.

1.  Identify 5 common patterns that make up your website.  These could be generic patterns, like headers, headings, paragraphs, lists, or patterns that are specific to your website, like product description, shopping cart, etc.

2.  Create a new directory in your repository and call it "patterns".  Create a new index.html in the patterns folder.  You can use the HTML code below to fill in the default HTML header code.

3.  You could create a separate styles.css.  However, since you already have a working stylesheet in your templates folder, you can instead change the link tag to reference the existing stylesheet (in the templates folder).  Hint: it will probably be: link href="../templates/style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen"

4.  Add a heading titled Pattern Library.

5.  Copy the code for your 5 patterns onto your pattern library, each separated with a heading.

6.  Under typography, document the fonts used on your website.

7.  Under colors, document the colors used on your website.  You might display these in the actual colors.

You can <a href="http://rwdkent.com/patterns/">view the pattern library for the RWD Kent State site</a> to see an example.

### Adding HTML + Stylesheet

<dl>
 <dt>Graduate Students Only</dt>
 <dd>Provide a mock timeline and estimated cost structure plan for completing the project.  This should include what you've already implemented with your design prototype, as well as the implementation of the website within a content management system.  Note: Graduate students will receive a grade that may vary from their partner for this group assignment.</dd>

## Class Evaluations

The class is going to help give you feedback on your prototypes and pattern libraries.  As you show your project, the class will respond to a survey with the following items:

1.  Does the website meet the initial goals defined for the website?  Why or why not?  

2.  What are some things that were done well?

3.  What are some things that could be improved?

The class will turn in their anonymous evaluations after each presentation.  Participation in the evaluations is part of your participation in the class.

## How to Turn In the Assignment

There is nothing to submit for this assignment, but in order to get the points you must:

1.  Participate in the review class period by filling out an evaluation for each project.
2.  Be present and participate in your project review during class.  

Although there is nothing to submit, you may find it helpful to prepare some bullet points/notes to help you and your partner stay on track during your discussion.

## Rubric

Use the following rubric to ensure you receive the highest possible grade for the assignment:

* **4-5**: You and your partner showed all of the required components.  You were able to intelligently answer questions and showed critical thinking in your design decisions.  Your decisions matched your intial goals.  You discussed what your next steps would be, were you to complete the website. Both partners participated in the discussion and you also participated in the review of other group projects.
* **2-3**: You and your partner presented, but some of the required items were missing.  You were unsure or unable to back up some of your design decisions, and weren't as convincing as you could have been.  One partner may have dominated the discussion.
* **0-1**: Your review lacked coherance and it is clear that you didn't put a lot of thought into your decisions or prepare for the discussion.  Next steps weren't discussed, and the client is left with a lot of questions.  You may not have participated at all in the class review by asking questions or giving feedback.
