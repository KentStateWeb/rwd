Part of understanding responsive web design is understanding the current and past landscape of web design.  It's also important that future web designers are able to talk about responsive web design, demonstrate their process and understand key terminology (aka developer talk). For the Explore RWD assignment, you'll be assigned one of the following following "websites", "words", "people" or "tech tool".  


## 1: Website Option (Up to 4 Groups)

Many web designers are open about their processes and have documented them in an article or podcast.  After doing some quick research, you and a partner will put together a **5-7 minute** summary (no slides) for the class (with a partner selected in class) that covers the following:

1.  **Goals For Going Responsive**:  Introduce the website and describe the problems were they trying to solve by going responsive?  
2.  **Redesign Process**: What process and technologies did they use to design and develop the website?  How did they get feedback on design direction?  What ways did they test their design?  Was the design done in house or through an outside agency?
3.  **Measuring Success**:  Were they successful?  How did they measure their success?  
4.  **Demo**:  Show the class some representative pages and how they display at different screen sizes.  Tell us what you think works well and what could be improved.
5.  **Favorite Pattern + Code**:  Tell us a pattern used on the website that you think is effective any why.  Show the code used to create this pattern using the browser's Inspector tool.
5.  **Graduate Students Only**: In addition to the criteria listed above, a few slides should be included to help guide the presentation, along with screenshots and visual examples, where needed.

The link included with each website is a starting point.  There may be other information available from other sources to help inform your research.

## 2: Word Option

We'll cover a lot this semester, but we won't get to every single topic in web design/development.  Choose a word/topic you're unfamiliar with, research what it is and find places it's being used on the web.  

* SVG
* CSS Animation and Transitions
* SASS


## 3: Tech Tool Option

* Sketch
* Adobe XD
* Grunt and Gulp (a little on the technical side, good for DSCI)
* MAMP Pro
* Content Management Systems (give/demo examples)
* TypeKit & Google Fonts


## 4: Person/Company Option

* Ethan Marcotte
* Karen McGrane
* Sparkbox (Dayton, OH)
* HappyCogg (New york)
* Superfriendly


## Due Dates

To keep things interesting, we're going to choose "rolling" due dates at the start of each class.  You'll choose a date to present your case study during the first class, and it will be due at the beginning of class on that date.  

* Jan 24 (2 groups) -
* Jan 31 (2 groups) -
* Feb 07 (2 groups) -
* Feb 14 (2 groups) -
* Feb 21 (1 group) - 

## Case Study Options: To Be Assigned In Class



## Rubric

Use the following rubric to ensure you receive the highest possible grade for the assignment:

* **3-4**: The presentation includes details about each of the three goals.  The presenter is well-prepared and familiar with their assigned website, demonstrated by the ability to answer questions from the instructor and class.  The presenter is able to demonstrate how their research is reflected in the final product, as well as think critically about whether or not the end product met their business goals.  The class presumably would gain valuable insight from the presentation.  If graduate student, slides are appropriate and add to the presentation.
* **2**: The presentation includes the required parts, but could have used more detail and research in order to back up their findings.  The presenter demonstrates the final product, but hasn't thought critically about how it was implemented or whether it was successful.  The class learns a few things, but not anything they couldn't have learned via Google.
* **0 - 1**: The presentation is missing one or more of the required parts, and the presenter is not familiar with their website they were assigned.  The presentation does not give the class very much insight into the process or inform the class of anything new.  The presenter is unable to describe the final product or give any insight into the success of the redesign.
