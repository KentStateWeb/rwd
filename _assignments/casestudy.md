Part of understanding responsive web design is understanding the current and past landscape of web design.  It's also important that future web designers are able to talk about responsive web design, demonstrate their process and understand key terminology (aka developer talk). For the Explore RWD assignment, you'll be assigned one of the following following "websites", "topics, "tech tools" or "person/company".

## 1: Website Option (Up to 4 Groups)

Many web designers are open about their processes and have documented them in an article or podcast.  After doing some quick research, you and a partner will put together a **5-7 minute** summary for the class (with a partner selected in class) that covers the following:

1.  **Goals For Going Responsive**:  Introduce the website and describe the problems were they trying to solve by going responsive?  
2.  **Redesign Process**: What process and technologies did they use to design and develop the website?s Was the design done in house or through an outside agency?
3.  **Demo**:  Show the class some representative pages and how they display at different screen sizes.  Tell us what you think works well and what could be improved.
4.  **Favorite Pattern + Code**:  Tell us a pattern used on the website that you think is effective any why.  Show the code used to create this pattern using the browser's Inspector tool.

The link included with each website is a starting point.  There may be other information available from other sources to help inform your research.

## 2: Topic Option (Up to 3 Groups)

We'll cover a lot this semester, but we won't get to every single topic in web design/development.  This is a chance to explore more about a topic (even before diving into the specific web design).  

Choose a word/topic you're unfamiliar with, then:

1. Tell us about the word/topic and why it may be useful to a designer or developer.  

2. Find 2 examples of this topic being used on the web.  This could be in a code example, like on CodePen, or on an actual live website.  You may need to use the Web Inspector tool in your browser to see for sure.

3. Demo those 2 examples for the class.

* [Scaleable Vector Graphics (SVG)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) - an infinitely scaleable, vector graphics format that is used on the web.  SVGs can also be animated.  Commonly constructed in a graphics program like Illustrator or Sketch.  Can also manipulated through code.
* CSS [Animation](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/animation/) and [Transitions](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/) - A way to manipulate, transition and move elements on a web page, similar to video.  Very popular today.
* CSS Blend Modes ([Mix Blend Mode](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/m/mix-blend-mode/) and [Background Blend Mode](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-blend-mode/)) - A way to achieve blend modes found in programs like Illustrator and Photoshop by applying them to live elements via simple CSS properties.
* [Print-Friendly Style Sheets](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/how-to-set-up-a-print-style-sheet/) - A way to customize how web pages look when printed.  Something we often forget about!
* [Accelerated Mobile Project (AMP)](https://www.ampproject.org) and [Facebook Instant Articles](https://instantarticles.fb.com) - Two different methods from Google and Facebook to provide faster access to internet content, while controversial because of their proprietary implementations.
* [Web Navigation Patterns](http://bradfrost.com/blog/web/responsive-nav-patterns/) including [Priority+](https://css-tricks.com/diy-priority-plus-nav/), [Bottom Navigation](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/11/the-golden-rules-of-mobile-navigation-design/)) - different ways of presenting navigation in responsive contexts, including some that are less common but possible improvements

## 3: Tech Tool Option (Up to 3 Groups)

These are all popular downloadable or browser-based tools/software that can aid in the design and development of websites and interactive media.  Choose a tool option and do the following:

1.  Tell us about the tool, its features and how it could be useful to a web developer or designer (in a way everyone can understand)
2.  Open the tool or application on screen and allow us to see it in action.  Different tools may be demoed in different ways, but it's good to have a pre-made example made in order to give some context, rather than starting from scratch.  
3.  Tell us whether or not you'd personally reach to this tool in a project after having used it.

* [Sketch](http://sketchapp.com) - A lightweight Mac digital design tool that many are using as an alternative to Adobe Illustrator.  Free trial available.
* [Adobe XD](http://www.adobe.com/products/experience-design.html) - A design tool made specifically for prototyping and sharing websites and mobile apps.  Becoming more popular.
* [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) (a little on the technical side, good for DSCI)  - JavaScript-based tools accessed via the command line for automating common or time-consuming tasks during web development
* [MAMP Pro](http://mamp.info) - (a little on the technical side, good for DSCI) - a tool for turning your computer into a web server.  Used commonly for applications that require PHP, MySQL or Apache.   
* Content Management Systems (give/demo examples) - a broad term used to describe software that allows users to log in to a web site to edit the content, without knowing HTML.  Popular CMS solutions are [Drupal](http://drupal.org) and [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org), but there are thousands.
* [TypeKit](http://typekit.com) & [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) - two popular solutions for using custom typography on your website.  Both include a free option.
* [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com) - a popular way to track who is coming to your website, what they're accessing and how often it is accessed.
* [Favicons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) and [Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net) - Ever wonder what the little images in your address/tab bar are in your browser?  Now you know what they're called (and the Favicon Generator website can help you make them).
* [Web Page Test](http://webpagetest.org) and [Google PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/) - Two popular ways to measure the performance (speed) of your website.  You can actually measure any website here, not just your own.

## 4: Person/Company Option (Up to 3 Groups)

These are some popular people and companies in the areas of web/interaction design and development.  Choose a person or company that you're interested in and tell us about the following:

1.  The company/person's background and they type of work that they do.  How do they brand themselves and is it effective?
2.  What sorts of projects have they worked on?  What did the projects involve, and how did the person/company use their unique skills to make them a success?
3.  Demo 2 projects for the class that the person/company has worked on and tell us what you think was effective.  
4.  Pick out one design pattern from these projects that you think is effective.  If you can, show us that pattern using the Web Inspector tool in your browser.

## Rubric

Use the following rubric to ensure you receive the highest possible grade for the assignment:

* **3-4**: The presentation includes details about each of the three goals.  The presenter is well-prepared and familiar with their assigned website, demonstrated by the ability to answer questions from the instructor and class.  The presenter is able to demonstrate how their research is reflected in the final product, as well as think critically about whether or not the end product met their business goals.  The class presumably would gain valuable insight from the presentation.  If graduate student, slides are appropriate and add to the presentation.
* **2**: The presentation includes the required parts, but could have used more detail and research in order to back up their findings.  The presenter demonstrates the final product, but hasn't thought critically about how it was implemented or whether it was successful.  The class learns a few things, but not anything they couldn't have learned via Google.
* **0 - 1**: The presentation is missing one or more of the required parts, and the presenter is not familiar with their website they were assigned.  The presentation does not give the class very much insight into the process or inform the class of anything new.  The presenter is unable to describe the final product or give any insight into the success of the redesign.
