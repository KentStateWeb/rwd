<h3 id="course-schedule">Course Schedule</h3>
<p>This course will be divided into four parts.  Readings, lecture notes and information on preparing for class will be posted to the class website on GitHub.</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="/class/schedule">Detailed Course Schedule</a> for specific dates, times and assignments.</p>

<h4 id="part-1-principles-of-responsive-web-design-and-html">Part 1: Principles of Responsive Web Design and HTML</h4>
<p>Students explore the concept of responsive web design, learn why it matters and will begin implementing simple HTML + CSS elements and selectors in the browser.  Students will read Responsive Web Design by Ethan Marcotte as part of this section, and will refer to the HTML and CSS textbook frequently.</p>

<h4 id="part-2--content-strategy-and-mobile-first-design">Part 2:  Content Strategy and Mobile-First Design</h4>
<p>Students will apply research findings to a content prototype, which will collect, organize and prioritize the most important information.  Students will read Mobile-First Design by Luke Wroblewski as part of this section, and will continue to learn intermediate HTML/CSS techniques.  We’ll also discuss the various research techniques that designers typically use to influence the design and architecture of a website.  </p>

<h4 id="part-3--design-and-development-with-css">Part 3:  Design and Development with CSS</h4>
<p>In the third part, students will begin an iterative design process, where they’ll mock-up design components in digital styles through a program called Sketch and then turn those components into reusable HTML/CSS pattern libraries. Students will learn the importance of designing a visual language for their websites using web typography, colors, user interface elements and layouts.  In this section, students will study Atomic Design, a methodology developed by Brad Frost, as well as get an introduction to CSS preprocessing techniques using SASS.</p>

<h4 id="part-4--prototyping-testing-and-style-guides">Part 4:  Prototyping, Testing and Style Guides</h4>
<p>In the final part, the content and design will begin to come together in the form of prototypes.  We will discuss and implement different techniques for web layouts and grid systems.  Prototypes may include interactive components from third-parties that use customized use Jquery and/or JavaScript.  Students will learn how prototypes are tested with usability testing.  They will also be exposed to performance and technical testing.  Part 4 will end with the presentation and class critique of a website prototype.  We’ll briefly discuss how this prototype might be translated into a content management system or hosted as a static website.</p>

<h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>
<p>Student learning will be assessed through three types of work: in-class participation, short assignments and a multi-stage small group project.  Due to the amount of group work in this course, students will also be evaluated by their peers.</p>

<p>There are <strong>100</strong> total possible points for the semester.</p>

<h3 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h3>

<p>We’ll be covering many topics during class, as well as working in groups on exercises to help you master web design techniques.  Therefore, attending each of the 15 classes is crucial.  I will allow <strong>two missed classes</strong> for the semester.  All subsequent absenses will only be accepted for the following reasons:  sickness (with medical note only), athletic event (with coach’s note), religious observation, military responsibility (with documentation) and death in the family (with documentation).  </p>

<p>Students who miss more than two classes without proper documnetation will receive a 0 for their class participation grade for the semester.</p>

<p>If you miss class, you are still responsibile for contacting the instructor to see what was assigned that day, as well as meeting all assignment deadlines.</p>

<h3 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h3>
<p>The assignments deadlines are to help you manage the workload and stay on track with the course. If an assignment will be late, students must contact the instructor and explain. Kent State accepts the following reasons for late assignments: sickness with medical note, athletic event (with coach’s note), religious observation, military responsibility (with documentation), death in the family (with documentation). </p>

<p>My policy for late assignments has 3 rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Late assignments will be accepted so long as you contact the instructor to indicate that it will be late and provide an explanation.</li>
  <li>Late assignments must be submitted within 1 week of the original due date, without penalty, so long as the student meets the first rule. After 1 week the assignment will be marked as 0.</li>
  <li>An additional extension may be possible in exceptional circumstances, with documentation. This requires a face-to-face conversation between the student and the instructor.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

<p>Final letter grades will be assigned on the basis of the following table:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Letter</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">Percentage</th>

<h3 id="hardware--software">Hardware &amp; Software</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Although a laptop is not required, if you have a laptop you are encouraged to bring it to class, as it may be helpful for following along in class.  You’ll also be viewing and testing your work on multiple devices, so phones and tablets are encouraged.</li>
  <li>Computers will be provided for in-class work.  Students will also be permitted to work on these computers outside of class, when needed.</li>
  <li>We will be using a variety of free and paid software programs and tools. </li>
  <li>Paid software may only be used on university-owned computers and will be provided at no charge.  If you would like to use paid software on your personal computer, you will need to purchase a license.</li>
  <li>Software programs and tools to be used in the course include: Sketch, GitHub, Git, SublimeText, web browsers and Google Drive.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="design-notebook">Design Notebook</h3>
<p>You are expected to obtain a design notebook, or sketchbook, and bring it to class. You will use this to collect ideas, sketch out designs, and capture your design thoughts on paper. You can use something fancy (e.g., a Moleskine) or something cheap (e.g., a composition notebook). Whatever you choose, you are expected to have a design notebook, carry it with you throughout the term, and bring it to every class. I strongly recommend having a bound notebook, not loose pages. </p>

<p>Withdrawal from any or all courses is permitted through the 10th week of the semester (or the prorated deadline for flexibly scheduled sections). After that time, students are considered to be committed to all remaining courses and must complete them. If students are unable to complete the semester because of extreme circumstances that first occur after the deadline, students should consult their college or campus dean’s office. Any course withdrawal(s) processed after the second week of the full semester will appear on the students’ academic record with a grade of “W”. No approval is required to withdraw from a course during the withdrawal period.  A “hold” on your record will prevent you from processing course withdrawal(s) until all holds are cleared. Course withdrawal may impact degree progress. Therefore, consult with your advisor prior to processing your course withdrawal.</p>

<h4 id="incomplete-grades">Incomplete grades</h4>
<p>The administrative mark of IN (Incomplete) may be given to students who are unable to complete the work due to extenuating circumstances. To be eligible, undergraduate students must be currently passing and have completed at least 12 weeks of the semester. Graduate students must be currently earning a C or better grade and are unable to complete the required work between the course withdrawal deadline and the end of classes. The time line shall be adjusted appropriate for summer sessions and flexibly scheduled courses.  Appropriate documentation is generally required to support the extenuating circumstance. The student must initiate the request for the Incomplete mark from the instructor, and it is the responsibility of the student to arrange to make up the incomplete work. Incomplete grades must be made up within one semester (not including summer sessions) for undergraduate students and one calendar year for graduate students. Unless the course is completed or an extension is granted, incomplete grades will automatically lapse to the grade designated on the Incomplete Mark Form at the end of one semester for undergraduate students and at the end of one year for graduate students.</p>

<h4 id="university-use-of-electronic-mail">University use of electronic mail</h4>
<p>A university-assigned student email account shall be an official university means of communication with all students at Kent State University. Students are responsible for all information sent to them via their university-assigned email account. If a student chooses to forward information in their university email account, he or she is responsible for all information, including attachments, sent to any other email account. To stay current with university information, students are expected to check their official university email account and other electronic communications on a frequent and consistent basis. Recognizing that some communications may be time-critical, the university recommends that electronic communications be checked minimally twice a week.</p>

<h4 id="plagiarism-and-academic-integrity">Plagiarism and academic integrity</h4>
<p>Students enrolled in the university, at all its campuses, are to perform their academic work according to standards set by faculty members, departments, schools and colleges of the university; and cheating and plagiarism constitute fraudulent misrepresentation for which no credit can be given and for which appropriate sanctions are warranted and will be applied. For more information: http://www.kent.edu/plagiarism.</p>

<h4 id="students-with-disabilities">Students with disabilities</h4>
<p>(Revised 6/01/07) University policy 3342-3-01.3 requires that students with disabilities be provided reasonable accommodations to ensure their equal access to course content. If you have a documented disability and require accommodations, please contact the instructor at the beginning of the semester to make arrangements for necessary classroom adjustments. Please note, you must first verify your eligibility for these through Student Accessibility Services (contact 330-672-3391 or send us an e-mail at sas@kent.edu or visit http://www.kent.edu/sas for more information on registration procedures).</p>

<h4 id="student-survey-of-instruction-evaluation">Student survey of instruction evaluation</h4>
<p>It is a standard practice of Kent State University to distribute and administer to the learners a confidential and anonymous questionnaire at the completion of the course. The results will be forwarded to the Instructor only at the completion of the class and the submission of all grades. The Instructor will then incorporate the feedback received in future course offerings and in his continual improvement of the course. Please candidly and honestly describe your opinions of the strengths and weakness you experienced as a learner in the course.</p>

<h4 id="notice-of-my-copyright-and-intellectual-property-rights">Notice of my copyright and intellectual property rights</h4>
<p>Any intellectual property displayed or distributed to students during this course (including but not limited to powerpoints, notes, quizzes, examinations) by the professor/lecturer/instructor remains the intellectual property of the professor/lecturer/instructor. This means that the student may not distribute, publish or provide such intellectual property to any other person or entity for any reason, commercial or otherwise, without the express written permission of the professor/lecturer/instructor.</p>
