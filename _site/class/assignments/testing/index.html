	<p>As you begin building your templates/prototype, you’ll need to think about how real people will use and interact with them.  At the same time, you have technical concerns as well (browsers, speed, etc.).  This testing plan will help you validate some of these concerns.</p>

<p>We will run through your testing plan in class, on November 24, 2015. </p>

<h2 id="creating-your-usability-plan">Creating Your Usability Plan</h2>

<p>First, we need to consider the top goals for your website.  Then,  we’ll develop some actionable tasks that you can test with real users based on your goals.  Your goals and tasks can be listed in a Google Doc.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Develop and write down 5 of your website’s top goals.  You may have defined many of these already in your previous assignments.  A goal is something like “Allow a customer to quickly find our hours of operation”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Based on each goal, create a task that a user will be able to complete using your website templates.  Note:  It’s okay that your website is not complete yet.  You can test much of the functionality even when the website is not complete.  In fact, it’s better to test early.  A task is typically scenario based and is something like “It’s Saturday night around 8 and you’d like to see if Business Name is still open.  Find the answer using the website.”  Tasks should frame real-life scenarios that your users might encounter and should not lead them directly to the answer.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="creating-your-technical-testing-plan">Creating Your Technical Testing Plan</h2>

<p>Unlike usability testing, technical testing resolves around technology.  When developing your testing plan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create a grid in Google Sheets.  In your sheet, list your 5 user testing tasks.  These will be the same as your usability test, but you’re going to run through them on different devices and browsers to ensure they can be completed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In each column of your spreadsheet, list the following browsers and devices, which you’ll test:  Internet Explorer 9, Internet Explorer 10, Safari (Mac), Chrome (PC), Firefox (Mac), Mobile Safari (iOS), Chrome (Android).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When conducting your tests, you’ll note whether each task passed/failed and any applicable notes.  You’re looking for any visual problems or technical issues that you encounter while completing the tasks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the day of our testing, you’re going to run a few performance/speed tests to identify ways to improve your website’s speed.  You’re going to note the results on the spreadsheet as well.  Run a test at http://webpagetest.org and https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/ .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the day of testing, note the following results:  Google Page Speed - Mobile Score and Desktop Score.  Web Page Test - Load Time (First View), Start Render Time (First View), Bytes In (Fully Loaded).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Note:  Your performance results will not impact your grade in any way at this time.  It’s just a benchmark from which you can make improvements.</p>

<h2 id="accessibility-test">Accessibility Test</h2>

<p>This will be done on the day of testing.  </p>

<ol>
  <li>Run through the Web Accessibility Checklist at http://a11yproject.com/checklist.html and ensure your website has the applicable landmark roles, etc. and make fixes.  You can likely skip the Forms part.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note:  Simply following this checklist does not ensure your website is compliant, but it’s a good starting point.  The only way to truly test accessibility is to have real participants with disabilities test the site.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Run the accessibility test at http://wave.webaim.org.  In your spreadsheet, note any Errors (Red).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-to-turn-in-the-assignment">How to Turn In the Assignment</h2>

<p>You’ll be submitting the links to your various documents via your project repository.  The content will be filled in on the date of testing in class. </p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a publicly shareable Google Drive link that points to your content.</li>
  <li>On your root index.html file, which is the Project Hub, add an H2 with Date: Usability and Technical Testing.</li>
  <li>Add a link to your various Google documents (at a minimum, a list of testing tasks and a spreadsheet for testing) under the H2.  There’s nothing else to upload to your site for this assignment, since it is in Google Drive.  Don’t forget to make your links publicly accessible!</li>
  <li>After you’ve commited and synced your changes via GitHub Desktop, you can submit both the timeline hyperlink and the link to the Google folder via Blackboard Learn.  Note: Don’t link to the local version on your computer.  You need to access the live version on the web with the GitHub.io URL.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="rubric">Rubric</h2>

<p>Use the following rubric to ensure you receive the highest possible grade for the assignment:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>8-10</strong>: Your usability tasks match your website’s goals, and show that you put some thought into them.  They match real-world scenarios and don’t lead the user directly to the answer.  You created a technical testing plan in a Google Spreadsheet that follows the directions.  Finally, on the day of testing in class, you participated in the testing and completely filled out your testing documents.</li>
  <li><strong>4-7</strong>: Usability tasks are complete, but could have been better thought out to match user goals.  Your technical testing spreadsheet is missing some of the content.  Your group may have not fully completed testing in class.</li>
  <li><strong>0 - 3</strong>: Usability tasks show little thought and are too leading.  Your technical testing plan is missing more than one key parts.  You or your partner may have missed class completely and did not complete the testing in class.   </li>
</ul>
