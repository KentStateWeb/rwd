	<p>We’re almost done!  Now that you’ve developed template prototypes and a pattern library, it’s time to do a final review with your “client” and the class.  There won’t be any slides or reports to turn in - you’ll only be showing your project timeline, prototypes and style guide.</p>

<p>The review sessions will take place in class on December 15 and will be extended into finals week, if needed.  All materials are due in class of December 15, regardless.  No extensions will be granted.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do">What To Do</h2>

<p>Here’s what you’ll review with the class/client during your review session.  Each review should take about 20 minutes.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Bring up your Project Hub.  This will be the main “presentation”.</li>
  <li>Briefly review the history of the project, starting from the research assignment.  Be sure to touch on the main goals you identified for the website.  Discuss each part briefly.</li>
  <li>Show the three templates and discuss each of them.  Demonstrate how the design changes at different breakpoints.  Discuss any decisions you had to make.</li>
  <li>Show your components together in the pattern library, and briefly discuss each of those components.</li>
  <li>Discuss any next steps.  What would you have done with more time?  What still remains to be decided?</li>
  <li>Ask for feedback and questions from the class/”client”.  Note - I may ask some questions during your review, just like a client might do.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="class-evaluations">Class Evaluations</h2>

<p>The class is going to help give you feedback on your prototypes and pattern libraries.  As you show your project, the class will respond to a survey with the following items:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Does the website meet the initial goals defined for the website?  Why or why not?  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are some things that were done well?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are some things that could be improved?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The class will turn in their anonymous evaluations after each presentation.  Participation in the evaluations is part of your participation in the class.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-turn-in-the-assignment">How to Turn In the Assignment</h2>

<p>There is nothing to submit for this assignment, but in order to get the points you must:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Participate in the review class period by filling out an evaluation for each project.</li>
  <li>Be present and participate in your project review during class.  </li>
</ol>

<p>Although there is nothing to submit, you may find it helpful to prepare some bullet points/notes to help you and your partner stay on track during your discussion.</p>

<h2 id="rubric">Rubric</h2>

<p>Use the following rubric to ensure you receive the highest possible grade for the assignment:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>4-5</strong>: You and your partner showed all of the required components.  You were able to intelligently answer questions and showed critical thinking in your design decisions.  Your decisions matched your intial goals.  You discussed what your next steps would be, were you to complete the website. Both partners participated in the discussion and you also participated in the review of other group projects.</li>
  <li><strong>2-3</strong>: You and your partner presented, but some of the required items were missing.  You were unsure or unable to back up some of your design decisions, and weren’t as convincing as you could have been.  One partner may have dominated the discussion.</li>
  <li><strong>0-1</strong>: Your review lacked coherance and it is clear that you didn’t put a lot of thought into your decisions or prepare for the discussion.  Next steps weren’t discussed, and the client is left with a lot of questions.  You may not have participated at all in the class review by asking questions or giving feedback.</li>
</ul>
