	<p>You understand the content of your website and have some ideas about its architecture.  Now it’s time to develop the visual language of the website.  We’re not going to start with full-scale mockups though and instead use a technique called <a href="http://styletil.es">Style Tiles</a>.  Style Tiles allow you to communicate the personality of your website to a client - typography, colors, common UI elements - without designing the entire site at different breakpoints.  </p>

<p>We’re going to use a program called Sketch to develop the Style Tiles.  I chose Sketch because it’s vector-based (unlike Photoshop) and very simple to learn (unlike Illustrator).  However, that doesn’t mean it’s the one and only best program for developing static designs - it’s just one I’d like you to try for this class.</p>

<h2 id="compile-a-list-of-adjectives">Compile a List of Adjectives</h2>

<p>Before you start, go through your notes from the initial client “meeting”.  Make a list of adjectives that you’ve heard.  Did they use keywords like “energetic” or “formal”?  “Friendly” or “Traditional”?  This list will help you develop your tiles.</p>

<p>Also, take another look at your competitor’s websites that the client mentioned.  What attributes do you see on these sites that might inspire your tiles?</p>

<h2 id="create-two-sets-of-style-tiles">Create Two Sets of Style Tiles</h2>

<p>After you’ve compiled your adjectives, you’re going to put together two, single canvas tiles in Sketch.  Your tiles should include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Typography Choices</li>
  <li>Color Choices</li>
  <li>Logo - you may make minor modifications to the logo, if you can justify it to your client.</li>
  <li>Adjective list - adjectives that you picked out from your notes</li>
  <li>A few UI elements - these will be different for everyone.  For example, a restaurant website is probably going to have some kind of menu.  An online retailer probably will have a shopping cart.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why two variations?  This will allow you to try out a few different ideas and let your client give feedback on both approaches.  That way, you can refine them into your final design.  You may choose to approach one variation as the “safe” or “conservative” design and another one that is more of a stretch from their current design language.</p>

<p><strong>A few things to note:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>These are not comps or mock-ups of a website.  This is an early design stage.  Don’t make your style tiles look like a web page.</li>
  <li>Include real content, where necesary.  Lorem Ipsum is easy to generate, but it isn’t realistic and commonly results in questions like “Why is there Latin all over my website?”.</li>
  <li>These are not final.  You should create an iterate on your style tyles rapidly, but with thought.  Think of these as sketching on screen.</li>
  <li>You and your partner should work on these together.  If you are more comfortable with design, let your partner drive the computer while you give feedback.  This needs to be a collaboration.</li>
  <li>We will do a show-and-tell in class on the due date.  You’ll show the class what you’ve done and I’ll ask a few questions, on behalf of the client.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-turn-in-the-assignment">How to Turn In the Assignment</h2>

<p>You’ll be submitting the style tiles to your project repository on GitHub as two PDF files. </p>

<ol>
  <li>Output your Sketch files as two PDFs.</li>
  <li>In your project repository, create a new folder called “style” and place the two PDF files inside.</li>
  <li>On your root index.html file, which is the Project Hub, add an H2 with Date: Style.</li>
  <li>Add a link to the two PDF files under your Style section.  The links should be something like “style/STYLETYLE1.pdf”.</li>
  <li>After you’ve commited and synced your changes via GitHub Desktop, you can submit both the timeline hyperlink and the link to the two Style Tile PDFs via Blackboard Learn.  Note: Don’t link to the local version on your computer.  You need to access the live version on the web with the GitHub.io URL.</li>
</ol>

<p>Your style tiles might look something like <a href="http://rwdkent.com/files/RWD-Style-Tiles.pdf">these tiles, used to create the RWD website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="rubric">Rubric</h2>

<p>Use the following rubric to ensure you receive the highest possible grade for the assignment:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>8 - 10</strong>: Your style tiles communicate the visual language that you’ve designed for your website.  They include the necessary elements (described above) and there are two unique variations.  The design utilizes type, colors and UI elements that effectively mirror your website’s goals.  You included adjectives that you discovered in your research.  Everything was submitted according to directions.</li>
  <li><strong>4 - 7</strong>: You’ve developed the two tiles, but they don’t include all of the elements, or they were developed as static comps/mockups instead of style tiles.  Style Tiles may lack needed detail.  Everything was submitted according to directions.</li>
  <li><strong>0 - 3</strong>: Your style tiles show little attention to client needs, and lack detail to effectively communicate your design language.  They may be missing required elements and the two variations may not be present.</li>
</ul>
