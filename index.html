<a id="about-the-course" class="anchor" href="#about-the-course" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About the Course</h2>

<p>In 2010, Ethan Marcotte published his famous article on A List Apart called Responsive Web Design.  The article was quickly followed the Responsive Web Design book, published by A Book Apart in 2011.  In this book, Ethan popularized the idea of using flexible grids and media queries to build websites that scale across phones, tablets and traditional computers.  </p>

<p>Since then, Responsive Web Design has become not just a technical solution for web design - it’s an entire process that brings multiple disciplines together to form one product that works across multiple devices.  The responsive design process includes user experience, content strategy, information architecture, visual design, HTML/CSS/JavaScript development, usability testing and technical testing. </p>

<p>In Kent State University's first-ever Responsive Web Design course, you will learn the fundamental principles for developing standards-based web sites from a mobile-first and content-first perspective.  We will explore each aspect of an agile-inspired process, during which you’ll learn each step of what it takes to build a responsive website and ensure its functionality for users in terms of both usability and performance.  </p>

<p>... and yes, every student will learn to write HTML and CSS code in this course using the latest web standards.</p>

<a id="hardware--software" class="anchor" href="#hardware--software" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hardware &amp; Software</h2>

<ul>
<li>Although a laptop is not required, if you have a laptop you are encouraged to bring it to class, as it may be helpful for following along in lectures.  You’ll also be viewing and testing your work on multiple devices, so phones and tablets are encouraged.</li>
<li>Computers will be provided for in-class work.  Students will also be permitted to work on these computers outside of class, when needed.<br>
</li>
<li>We will be using a variety of free and paid software programs and tools.  Paid software may only be used on university-owned computers and will be provided at no charge.  If you would like to use paid software on your personal computer, you will need to purchase a license.</li>
<li>Software programs and tools to be used in the course include: Sketch, GitHub, Git, SublimeText, CodePen and Google Drive.</li>
</ul>

<p>This website will continue to be updated with new information leading up to fall 2015.  It will also be used as our class website/repository.</p>
