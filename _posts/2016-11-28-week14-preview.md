We're nearly finished with the semester!  In the next class we'll go over your usability, accessibility and technical testing plans that you'll be using in class next week.

We'll also briefly go over a few last remaining responsive design items.  

You'll have some time to work on your HTML/CSS prototypes and pattern libraries in class as well.

In the last class, we:

* Worked on plans for in-class usability, accessibility and technical testing
* Discussed pattern libraries and style guides
* Reviewed how your static websites might be integrated into a dynamic content management system
* Talked to web designer Brad Frost

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

### Performance, Accessibility & Usability Testing

Based on the plan you've put together, we'll conduct testing in class, and you'll turn in the assignment on Blackboard and Project Hub next week.  Your prototype needs to be in working condition in order to conduct the testing tasks you've selected, but it does not need to be finished or look perfect by any means.

### Reading

There is one assigned reading that we'll be going over in class:

* [How Much Does a Responsive Design Cost?](http://bradfrost.com/blog/web/how-much-does-a-responsive-web-design-cost/)

### Evaluations

We'll be completing the university's course evaluation in class this week.

See you tomorrow!
