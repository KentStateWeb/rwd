The last class was all about content.  In the next class, we'll get into how to display that content using mobile-first principles.  

In the last class, we discussed:

* Our competitive research assignment + turned in the assignment using GitHub
* How to prioritize and write good content
* HTML images, tables, forms and other HTML elements
* Watched part of Karen McGrane's Mobile Content Mandate video

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

We'll be discussing the Mobile-First readings and your two new assignments, HTML Basics 2 and Content/Architecture.  We'll do some hands-on sketching, so be sure to bring your notebook/sketchbook.

We'll also have a guest speaker via video conference, Karen McGrane, Managing Partner, Bond Art + Science.  Please bring one question to ask Karen.  We'll get in as many questions as we can.

If you're interested in seeing more Karen McGrane talks, see [Adapting Ourselves to Adaptive Content](https://vimeo.com/56705945) and [I suck! And so do you!](http://2013.dareconf.com/videos/mcgrane).


### HTML Basics 2

This is an individual assignment and very similar to your first CodePen exercise.  This time, we'll be adding some new elements like figures, iframes, images and tables.  The assignment is due in CodePen and Blackboard Learn at the start of class.

### Content & Architecture

This is a continuation of your group project assignments.  For this piece, you'll be examining the content your "client" provided and editing/organizing it within Google Drive.  You'll then add the link to your content to your project repository in GitHub and submit the link to me via Blackboard (as a group). 

You'll have a few minutes to turn this in via GitHub at the beginning of class.

### Reading

There are two assigned readings for class.

* [Sketching - the Visual Thinking Power Tool by Mike Rohde](http://alistapart.com/article/sketching-the-visual-thinking-power-tool)
* Mobile First book - Ch. 1 Growth, Ch. 2 Constraints, Ch. 3 Capabilities


## Upcoming Assignments

We'll be starting some sketching for our projects, using mobile-first principles in class.  The [Sketching](/class/assignments/sketching/) assignment will be due for the next class.


## News and Announcements

Get out of your comfort zone!  If you don't normally write well, volunteer to do more writing for your group projects.  If you're still uncomfortable in HTML, write the code while your partner watches and helps you out.  This class is your chance to learn some new skills without the pressure of a real client or boss.
