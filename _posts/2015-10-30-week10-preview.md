title: Week 10 Preview - Responsive Images and HTML Wireframing
category: blog
---

We'll continue practicing with CSS Media Queries in class.  We'll also be talking more about how images can be made to be more responsive, and we'll start wireframing your project assignments in HTML.

In the last class, we:

* Discussed atomic web design
* Introduced media queries and how they contribute to flexible designs
* Reviewed Responsive Design patterns
* Started on the layout/media query assignment

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

### Layout/Media Queries Assignment

This is a difficult assignment.  It involves putting together everything you've learned so far, plus media queries and items like class names. 

I am going to **push back the due date for this assignment** to next week, Nov. 10.  This will give you some extra time to work on it during the next class and answer any questions.

## News and Announcements

We only have 5 classes left!  We'll begin concentrating less on reading and discussions, and more on your final project deliverables.  It's important that everyone contribute to their group's final work so that you can develop the best possible project!  I'm excited to see what you come up with.
