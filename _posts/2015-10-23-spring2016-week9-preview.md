Based on your survey responses so far and interest from other students, we've decided to repeat the RWD class for the spring 2016 semester!

## RWD Spring 2016

The class will be held at the same time and place:

* Tuesdays from 5:30 - 8: 15 p.m. at IdeaBase.
* Course number is CCI 40095-002 and CRN is 21660.  
* **Permission from the student's advisor is required in order to register for the course**.

Let your friends know and encourage them to contact their advisor to get them registered.  Please <a href="http://www.rwdkent.com">send them to the RWD website</a> or have them contact me with any questions about the course.

Many programs will substitute this class as one of the required program electives.  This is at the discretion of your school, so please reach out to your advisor to see how the course will count toward your degree.

## RWD Survey

The RWD class survey is still available until next week, and I encourage everyone to take the 5 minutes to respond.  Your responses will help me improve the remaining classes and future semesters.

In addition to the survey, in the last class we:

* Had an in-class show-and-tell for your Style Tiles
* Covered CSS boxes, layout and images
* Wrapped up the Mobile-First book
* Got started on the CSS Basics 2 assignment

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

We'll be putting together everything we've learned and covering HTML and CSS responsive layouts and media queries.  We'll also discuss the atomic design methodology.  Finally, we'll get started on the last mini-assignment, CSS Layout/Media Queries.

### CSS Basics 2

This is an individual CodePen assignment that we started in class.  In it, you're applying CSS styles as well as HTML5 elements to your pre-existing Welcome Weekend website.  You'll be using the whole family of CSS attributes to make this happen.  Submit the assignment like normal via Blackboard.
