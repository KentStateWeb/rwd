We'll be continuing our section on CSS and visual design patterns in the next class.

In the last class, we:

* Turned in and talked about your sketching assignments
* Started talking about CSS and worked on the first CSS mini assignment
* Talked about developing a visual language for your website using Style Tiles and Style Prototypes
* Introduced Sketch and TypeCast

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

We'll be continuing our discussion on CSS and mobile-first design.  We'll also work on style tiles for your website projects.

Additionally, we'll have two guests visit us.  Shawn Beatty and Jon Woodruff are web designers/developers at Nesnadny + Schwartz in Cleveland.  They'll be talking to you about how they approach web design, as well as working with you on your projects.

### CSS Basics Assignment

This is an individual assignment in CodePen.  We started it already in class.  It's due at the beginning of class on Tuesday.  In it, you'll be styling the Meida Ethics Conference web page using colors, fonts, line height, background-colors and font sizes.

### Reading

There are a few assigned readings for class.  I moved the Mobile-First book reading to this week, because we didn't get a chance to talk about it last week.

* HTML & CSS Book - Ch. 11 Color, Ch. 12 Text, Ch. 14 Lists Tables & Forms
* Mobile First Book - Ch.4 Organization, Ch. 5 Actions, Ch. 6 Inputs (if you didn't read this last week)
* [How We Read by Jason Santa Maria](http://alistapart.com/article/how-we-read)
* [Size Matters - Balancing Line Length and Font Size in Responsive Web Design](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/09/balancing-line-length-font-size-responsive-web-design/)


## Upcoming Assignments

During the next class we'll start on your Style Tiles assignment, and they'll be due as a part of your group project for the next class.  I'll also send out a mid-semester survey.


## News and Announcements

If you for some reason miss an assignment's due date, the syllabus states that you have 1 week after the due date to turn it in.  Just missing 5 points will impact your grade, so please stay on top of the work.
