All - hope you all had a great weekend.  I wanted to remind you that I'm offering 1-1 help and open office hours today, Monday from 3 p.m. - 5 p.m. at IdeaBase.  

Please feel free to stop by at any time (there will likely be several people there at the same time).  

Also, here's what is due for finals week:

## Remaining Assignments & Deliverables

Here are the remaining items you'll need to turn in for the semester.  

### Testing and Testing Results (5 pts)

We did technical, accessibility and usability testing in class last week.  You should have turned in the link to the Google Sheet via Blackboard.

### Dec. 12 at 5:30 p.m. - Final Templates/Prototypes (15 pts)

Your 3 final prototypes should be completed and online via GitHub before the final class.

Your prototypes should be linked together (so we can navigate them like a real site) but also linked from your Project Hub page.

You'll turn in the link to your final prototype via Blackboard for grading on Dec. 12.

### Dec. 12 at 5:30 p.m. - Project Hub, Pattern Library & Review Session (5 pts)

This is the final 10-15 minute presentation that you'll conduct on Tuesday of finals week (same as class time, 5:30 p.m.).  During this time, you'll demo all of your deliverables via your Project Hub page.  The class will also use your website on multiple devices and give you feedback by completing a short survey for each presentation.

This also includes a demo of a small Pattern Library showing 5 of your most common patterns used on the site.  Please follow the instructions on the website.

There is nothing to turn in on Blackboard for this part.

Here are some guidelines for your sharing sessions:

* Should Last About 10-15 minutes (these can be fairly informal)
* Bring up prototypes on multiple devices to pass around
* Bring Up Your Project Hub
* Brief History of Project (Goals, Process, etc.)
* Show Templates and Implementation at different breakpoints
* Show Main Components in Pattern Library
* Discuss Next Steps
* Get Feedback and Questions from Class/Client

During each presentation, each class member (and instructor) will use their own devices to submit an evaluation of the final project.

## Self & Group Assessment

After Tuesday, you'll still need to submit a separate survey that evaluates your individual and team performance.  Please wait until you've submitted your projects before taking the survey.  This is the last assignment you'll submit for RWD!
