We'll be continuing our section on CSS and visual design patterns in the next class.

In the last class, we:

* Turned in and talked about your sketching assignments
* Started talking about CSS and worked on the first CSS mini assignment
* Talked about developing a visual language for your website using Style Tiles and Style Prototypes
* Introduced Sketch and TypeCast

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

We'll be continuing our discussion on CSS properties (specifically typography) and go over your CodePen assignments.  We'll also work on style tiles for your website projects.  Finally, I'll give you a link to complete the mid-semester survey.

### CSS Basics Assignment

This is an individual assignment in CodePen.  We started it already in class.  It's due at the beginning of class on Tuesday.  In it, you'll be styling the Meida Ethics Conference web page using colors, fonts, line height, background-colors and font sizes.
