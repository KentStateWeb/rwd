title: Week Three - HTML and Research
category: blog
---

During the last session, we completed our in-class RWD case studies, set up GitHub and CodePen accounts and talked a bit about how HTML is used to structure a website.  

* Grades are up on Blackboard for all who completed their Case Study.  Log in to [Blackboard](http://learn.kent.edu), go to the Responsive Web Design course and then select Grades.
* The RWD assignment was intended to get you talking, especially with the class, familiarize you with what is out on the web today and help you understand and discuss how goals and process are integral to the web design process.
* We briefly hit on how HTML defines your content structure.  Using simple elements like Paragraph (p) and Headings (h) define the structure and hierarchy of a web page.
* Remember your CodePen ([www.codepen.io](http://www.codepen.io)) and GitHub ([www.github.com](http://www.github.com)) login information.  You'll need it for the remaining assignments in the class.
* GitHub is a place where people can store code and share code with others.  It uses a protocol called "Git" to update and make changes to files.
* CodePen is an online playground for trying out and sharing HTML, CSS and JavaScript code.  Real projects are rarely stored here - it is more of a practice or demonstration area.
* I (briefly!) struggled through saving an HTML file using TextEdit, forgetting to change the file type to Plain Text.  I will show you this next time.

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

Looking ahead to Week 3 (Sept. 15), we will be learning even more HTML and the principles behind responsive web design, setting up the first addition to your GitHub repository and beginning to discuss how to start your semester web projects using research.

### HTML Basics 1

HTML Basics 1 is due by the start of class on the 15th.  You'll complete this assignment using CodePen and then submit 2 URLs to me using Blackboard Learn.  

Submitting assignments is pretty easy - just log in to [Blackboard](http://learn.kent.edu), select the Responsive Web Design class, select Assignments and then select the assignment you're working on.  You'll paste the URLs into the text submission box, and then Submit the assignment.

In this assignment, you'll be writing some structured HTML using paragraphs, headings, links, lists and strong/emphasis.  There are some things in this assignment that we haven't formally discussed - that's intentional.  I want you to use what you've learned so far + the HTML book to find the answers.

### Reading

There are 3 assigned, short readings for class.  Completing the assigned reading will allow you participate in class discussions and also be prepared for our hands-on assignments.

* HTML&CSS Book - Ch. 3 Lists, Ch.4 Links (You'll need to read this in order to do the HTML assignment)
* [Focusing on Top Tasks](http://alistapart.com/article/what-really-matters-focusing-on-top-tasks)
* [Bringing Design and Research Together](https://24ways.org/2013/bringing-design-and-research-closer-together/)

## Upcoming Assignments

During class, I'll introduce your [semester projects](http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/project-summary.html) and we'll talk about the first project assignment, which is your [research/competitive analysis](http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/research).

## News and Announcements

Remember that you're allowed two absenses for the semester, but you need to let me know ahead of time.  Anything after 2 will impact your participation grade, and must be a university-documented excuse.

Thank you for your patience as we establish a rhythm for the class sessions. We'll continue to make adjustments as needed throughout the semester.  If you have any suggestions for our classes, [please let me know](mailto:challahan@ideabasekent.com) - I'd love to hear from you.
