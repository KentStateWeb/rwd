In the next class, we'll talk about how to test your websites for optimal usability and accessibility, while ensuring the websites work well on as many devices as possible.

In the last class, we:

* Discussed building for performance and progressive enhancement
* Integrating JavaScript into a website
* Worked on your HTML wireframes

Remember that you can access common RWD patterns and code samples on the RWD website at [http://www.rwdkent.com/common-patterns](http://www.rwdkent.com/common-patterns).

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

There's just one assignment due this week - HTML Content Wireframes. 

Remember, if you still owe me a CodePen assignment, please get it in this week.

### HTML Content Wireframes

Your HTML content wireframes are due at the beginning of class.  I'll ask a few groups to demo their wireframes for the class.  Remember, you only need to create 3 representative wireframes at a minimum.
