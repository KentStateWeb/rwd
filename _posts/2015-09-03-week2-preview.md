Thank you all for a great first class!   I think this is going to be an awesome semester.

You'll remember that during the first class we:

* Introduced ourselves
* Went over the syllabus and course schedule
* Talked about Responsive Design and why it's important
* Talked about what being a "web designer" is all about
* Learned about the history of web design and watched a video on Jeffery Zeldman
* Ate a lot of popcorn

I tweeted out a link to the Zeldman video on the @rwdKent account and Mr. Zeldman (@zeldman) retweeted and replied saying:

>"All credit belongs to the http://lynda.com  staff, who turned my nonsensical ramblings into a watchable video. :)"

You can follow [@RWDKent](https://twitter.com/rwdkent) on Twitter.

Looking ahead to Week 2 (Sept. 8), we will be diving into HTML, the building blocks of the web, using CodePen and exploring GitHub, a cloud-based community for hosting your web projects.

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

### RWD Case Study

Your first mini-assignment, the RWD Case Study, will be due at the beginning of class.  You can [read all about it](http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/casestudy/) on the RWD website.  There is nothing to turn in for this assignment - it will be a 5-minute discussion with the class (although you may want to make a few notes for yourself).  You can find your assigned website on the assignment page.  I think you'll enjoy investigating what goes on behind the scenes of a large-scale web redesign.

### Reading

There are 4 assigned, short readings for class.  Completing the assigned reading will allow you participate in class discussions and also be prepared for our hands-on assignments.  Be sure to do the readings each week or you may get lost in class.

* HTML&CSS Book - Introduction, Ch. 1 Structure, Ch.2 Text, Ch. 18 Process & Design (out of order)
* Responsive Web Design Book - Ch. 1 - Our Responsive Web
* [Absolute vs. Relative Paths and Links](http://www.coffeecup.com/help/articles/absolute-vs-relative-pathslinks/)
* [GitHub For Beginners](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1) - You don't have to set up the account, just read how to do it.  We'll do this in class.

## Upcoming Assignments

[HTML Basics 1](http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/html) will be assigned in class on Tuesday, and we'll get some hands-on time to work on it together.

## News and Announcements

### Coming to IdeaBase Outside of Class

I found that the Glyphix class meets on Mondays and Wednesdays from 11 a.m. to 1:45 p.m. at IdeaBase.  You can feel free to come in to IdeaBase and work on assignments outside of these times during normal business hours.  If you ever need to come in after 5 p.m. on a non-class night, let me know and I'll try to arrange letting you in.  Remember that the outside doors will lock at 7 p.m. on Tuesday nights.

### Parking

I still believe the parking meters on Main Street and in Kent are free after 5:00 p.m. on weeknights.  You can also park in the large lot behind Panini's for free.  Let me know if you hear anything different.

That's all for now.  Please email me back if you have any questions.  Have a great long weekend and I'll see you on Tuesday.
