title: Web Design Conference Scholarships Available
---

On September 25th the 3rd annual Rustbelt Refresh web design conference will be held at the Cleveland Public Library.  

This is a one-day conference where nationally-recognized designers and developers will speak about topics related to the web design industry.  You can learn about the conference at [www.rustbeltrefresh.com](http://rustbeltrefresh.com/scholarships.html). 

They are offering scholarships to select students (a $175 value) who would like to attend.  I encourage anyone from the RWD class (especially women and minorities) with an interest in web design to [apply](http://rustbeltrefresh.com/scholarships.html).  All that's required is answering 2 short questions.

The deadline for applications is August 28th.  

I will be attending the conference and we can talk about carpooling options for those who are going.

I've personally learned a lot from these conferences, so please consider applying for this great, local opportunity!
