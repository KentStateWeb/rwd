Since we're about half-way through the semester, the mid-semester survey will help me determine how things are going and where I can improve.  You'll also get the opportunity to share any feedback about how you and your partner are working together.

<a class="button" href="https://kent.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_9NuXg70jgbinJtP">Take the 5-Minute RWD Survey</a>

Please <a href="https://kent.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_9NuXg70jgbinJtP">take the 5 minutes to respond</a> - it's much appreciated!  

In the last class, we:

* Reviewed CSS properties including color, text, lists, tables and forms
* Reviewed and turned in the CSS Basics assignment
* Talked about how we read, and the importance of balancing line length and font size
* Started on Style Tiles for our projects

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

We'll be having a group discussion about your style tiles (the first part of this assignment is due at the start of class).  We'll also continue learning some new CSS properties, including CSS boxes, layout and images.

### Style Tiles

This is a group assignment that we started in class.  For the first part of the assignment, you'll be producing two variations of your site's visual language using Style Tiles in [Sketch](http://www.sketchapp.com).  

In class, you'll share and explain your thought process.  I'll ask a few questions, on behalf of the client.  Remember, the show-and-tell is also part of your Style Tiles grade, so be sure to think about how you'll respond.  I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with!

Your final Style Tiles assignment isn't due in Blackboard until next week, along with a site mockup, based on the feedback you hear in class.

### Reading

There is one reading assignment for class.  The CSS reading this week is going to be essential for learning media queries next week.  

* HTML & CSS Book:  Ch. 13 Boxes, Ch. 15 Layout, Ch. 16 Images

### Extras

Remember that you're able to miss 2 classes without a documented university excuse before your participation grade is affected.

Have a great weekend!
