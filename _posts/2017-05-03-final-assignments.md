Hi everyone - thanks for a great (and fast as always) class last night.

Can you believe how far you've come since the beginning of the semester?  I'm seeing unbelievable progress, and I'm sure current and future employers will as well!

Here's a summary of the final items to turn in and complete before the end of the semester, as well as ways to get help prior to Tuesday.

## Office Hours & 1-1 Help

Since I didn't get to speak to everyone in class, I am blocking out **3 p.m. - 5 p.m. on Monday the 8th** at IdeaBase for open office hours.  Please come by during this time (you can email me to let me know you're coming) for help with any of the below items.  

If this time doesn't work with you, please email me to schedule another time.  

Note that I will have VERY LIMITED time to help you prior to class on Tuesday, so don't rely solely on coming in early.

## Remaining Assignments & Deliverables

Here are the remaining items you'll need to turn in for next week.  

### Testing Results (5 pts)

Sorry we ran out of time to get through all of the testing in class!  Please complete the Google Sheet entirely (you may have finished most of it in class), share it so anyone can view it and link it from your project hub page.  

You should also turn in the link to the Google Sheet via Blackboard so that I can grade it.

### Final Templates/Prototypes (20 pts)

Your 3 final prototypes should be complete and online via GitHub.  It's important that you know the address to access your prototype from any computer or device.  Test this ahead of time on multiple devices.  

Your prototypes should be linked together (so we can navigate them like a real site) but also linked from your Project Hub page.

Turn in the link to your final prototype via Blackboard for grading.

### Project Hub, Pattern Library & Review Session (6 pts)

This is the final 10-15 minute presentation that you'll conduct on Tuesday of finals week (same as class time, 5:30 p.m.).  During this time, you'll demo all of your deliverables via your Project Hub page.  The class will also use your website on multiple devices and give you feedback by completing a short survey for each presentation.

This also includes a demo of a small Pattern Library showing 5 of your most common patterns used on the site.  

It's important that you know the public URL for your Project Hub page prior to Tuesday (not the version on your computer).  

There is nothing to turn in on Blackboard for this assignment.

### Group/Self Assessment (4 pts)

This is the final item you'll turn in.  It's an assessment of your performance during the project as well as the performance of your group members (if applicable).

This survey is available online at the link below and should be completed no later than Thursday of finals week (May 11).

That should be it for now!  Please email me if you have any questions, and I'll see everyone for our last time together on Tuesday!
