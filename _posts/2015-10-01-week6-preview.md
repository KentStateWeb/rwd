title: Week Six Preview - Design Patterns and CSS
category: blog
---

In the next class we go from content to talking about design patterns, styles and an introduction to CSS.  This means we'll finally start to add some colors, typography and visual styles to our HTML.

In the last class, we:

* Reviewed the HTML Basics 2 assignment and reviewed our website content
* Spoke live with Karen McGrane, who spoke about future career opportunities on the web, getting buy-in from stakeholders when working on web projects and the importance of serving good content to everyone, regardless of their device.
* Talked about Mobile First Design using the Luke Wroblewski book
* Discussed sketching and started our initial website sketches

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

We'll be jumping into Design Patterns, Style Tiles and Web Typography.  We'll be talking about a few new tools, Sketch and TypeCast, and also starting an introduction to CSS.  We'll also finish talking about the processes of going Mobile First.

### Project Sketches

This group assignment is due by the start of class.  You should have already started your sketches during the last class.  You'll be producing a minimum of 3 template sketches, snapping photos from your phone and uploading them to your GitHub project repositories.  As usual, you'll have a few minutes at the start of class to get your assignment turned in.  

Don't forget to submit your URLs to Blackboard as well so I can grade them.

## Upcoming Assignments

During the next class I'll assign your first CSS exercise in CodePen.  You'll be working on the Media Ethics site that you developed in a previous assignment.  If this is the first time you've written CSS, you'll really enjoy it.

By the way, CodePen [just launched their site-wide redesign](http://blog.codepen.io/2015/10/01/redesigned/), so you'll notice a lot of changes the next time you log on!


## News and Announcements

I'll be asking you all to complete an online, mid-semester survey soon for this course.  This will help the College and I plan for future semesters.  Start thinking about any feedback you have now and I'll be in touch.
