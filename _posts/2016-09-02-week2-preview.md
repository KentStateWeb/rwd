Thank you all for a great first class!   I think this is going to be an awesome semester.

Looking ahead to Week 2, we will be diving into HTML, the building blocks of the web, using CodePen and exploring GitHub, a cloud-based community for hosting your web projects.

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

### Introductory Survey

Take this quick survey before the start of the next class so that (a) I can get to know you better and (b) I can put you into more logical groups for your projects.

### RWD Case Study

Your first mini-assignment, the RWD Case Study, will be due at the beginning of class. There is nothing to turn in for this assignment - it will be a 5-minute discussion with the class (although you may want to make a few notes for yourself).  Please be sure both you and your partner participate.

### Reading

There are 2 assigned, short readings for class.  Completing the assigned reading will allow you participate in class discussions and also be prepared for our hands-on assignments.  Remember that there may be a random (1 point) quiz on the readings during any class.

* HTML&CSS Book - Introduction, Ch. 1 Structure, Ch.2 Text, Ch. 18 Process & Design (out of order)
* Responsive Web Design Book - Ch. 1 - Our Responsive Web

## Extras

### Coming to IdeaBase Outside of Class

The Glyphix class meets on Mondays and Wednesdays from 11 a.m. to 1:45 p.m. at IdeaBase.  You can feel free to come in to IdeaBase and work on assignments outside of these times during normal business hours.  If you ever need to come in after 5 p.m. on a non-class night, let me know and I'll try to arrange letting you in.  Remember that the outside doors will lock at 7 p.m. on Tuesday nights.

### Follow the Class Twitter

Remember to follow our class Twitter account [@rwdkent](http://twitter.com/rwdkent)!

That's all for now.  Please email me back if you have any questions.  Have a great (long) weekend and I'll see you on Tuesday.
