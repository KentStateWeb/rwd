In the next class, we'll talk about advanced web tools, common JavaScript/JQuery web patterns and how these can be integrated into a website while keeping performance in mind.

In the last class, we:

* Discussed responsive images and SVG
* Did some hands-on wireframing in HTML
* Worked on our final CodePen assignments

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

### Layout/Media Queries Assignment

This assignment will be due at the beginning of class.  Please come in and work with me on Monday or Tuesday if you need any additional help, since this will be your most challenging CodePen assignment yet.

### HTML Content Wireframes

In the last class, we started creating interactive wireframes to show the content and layout elements of your website prototypes in the browser.  Remember, these don't have to look pretty just yet!

You should be working on this assignment, but it isn't due until April 12.
