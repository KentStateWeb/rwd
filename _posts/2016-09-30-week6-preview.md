In the next class we go from content strategy to design patterns and an introduction to cascading style sheets (CSS).

In the last class, we:

* Reviewed the HTML Basics 2 assignment and talked about our website content
* Talked about and watched a video on Mobile First Design
* Discussed sketching and started our initial website sketches

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

It's time to start covering some web visual design concepts.  We'll be jumping into Design Patterns, Style Tiles and Web Typography.  We'll be talking about a few new tools, Sketch and TypeCast, and also starting an introduction to CSS with your first CSS assignment.

### Project Sketches

This group assignment is due by the start of class.  You should have already started your sketches during the last class.  You'll be producing a minimum of 3 mobile-first template sketches (you may also decide to show variations of each template), taking photos from your phone and uploading them to your GitHub project repositories.  As usual, you'll have a few minutes at the start of class to get your assignment turned in.

### Reading

There are a few assigned readings for class.  Remember that participation is part of your final grade, so it's important to read and be prepared to discuss these in every class.
