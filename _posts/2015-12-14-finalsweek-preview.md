category: blog
---

Get ready for Tuesday's (last) RWD class!  I'm excited to see what everyone has developed for their final projects.

## Tomorrow's Sharing Sessions

As you know, Tuesday, Dec. 15 is the date of our final class and we'll be starting our prototype sharing sessions at 5:30 p.m.

If you need assistance, please let me know and we'll schedule a time to meet prior to class.  Please don't expect to resolve bugs right before class begins.  

You should be working on your responsive <a href="http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/templates">HTML/CSS Templates</a>, <a href="http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/styleguide">Pattern Library</a> and <a href="http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/timeline-presentation">Project Timeline/Review Presentation</a> to prepare for the sharing session.

Here are some guidelines for your sharing sessions:

* Should Last About 20 minutes (these can be fairly informal)
* Bring Up Your Project Hub
* Brief History of Project (Goals, Process, etc.)
* Show Templates and Implementation at different breakpoints
* Show Main Components in Pattern Library 
* Discuss Next Steps
* Get Feedback and Questions from Class/Client

During each presentation, each class member (and instructor) will use their own devices to submit an evaluation of the final project.

## Self & Group Assessment

Remember that after Tuesday you'll still need to submit a survey that evaluates your individual and team performance.  I will send out one last reminder with that link, but it's also below.  Please wait until you've submitted your projects before taking the survey.

## Grades

I'll be grading your final projects by the end of the week.  Final grades are due in FlashLine next Tuesday.  PLEASE log in to Blackboard and check your gradebook.  I have everything graded that I've received, so if you see an assignment missing, please let me know soon.

Up to this point, we have **70 points** (out of 100), so you can calculate your grades so far.

Remaining items to be graded:

* HTML/CSS Final Prototypes (Submit as a group via Blackboard and your Project Hub like normal) - 10 points
* Pattern Library (Submit as a group via Blackboard and your Project Hub like normal) - 5 points
* Project Timeline, Presentation and Critiques (Nothing to submit - will do in class) - 5 points
* Participation (Nothing to submit - will award points by end of the week) - 5 points
* Group/Self Assessment (Each group member must submit the survey, referenced above) - 5 points

See you in class.  Best of luck on your other finals and congrats to our seniors who are graduating!
