title: HTML/CSS Text Editors for Windows & Mac
category: blog
---

I've gotten questions about which text editors are the best for installing on students' personal Windows/Mac computers.  

I've compiled a list of editors below that would work well for editing HTML/CSS.  For most of people, the free solutions will be more than enough.  

In our classroom computers, we have access to [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com) which is a paid product ($70).  You're definitely not required to purchase this software.  In fact, you can switch between different text editors depending on the computer you're using.

I don't recommend TextEdit (Mac) or NotePad (Windows).  While they work, they don't offer even the most basic features like code highlighting, and TextEdit tends to want to go into Rich Text mode by default.  I also didn't include programs like Adobe Dreamweaver here because, while they also would work, they are often too complex and bloated for basic editing.

## Free Text Editors

* [Atom](https://atom.io): This is actually developed by GitHub.  I've heard good things.
* [Brackets](http://brackets.io): From Adobe
* [NotePad++ (Windows Only)](https://notepad-plus-plus.org)
* [TextWranger (Mac Only)](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)

## Paid Text Editors

* [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com): Definitely the most popular right now.
* [UltraEdit](http://www.ultraedit.com)
* [BBEdit (Mac Only)](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/)
* [Coda (Mac Only)](https://panic.com/coda/)
* [Smultron (Mac Only)](https://www.peterborgapps.com/smultron/)
