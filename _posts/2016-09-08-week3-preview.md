title: Week Three - HTML Part 2 and Research
category: blog
---

Hope everyone had a great week!  During the last session, we completed our in-class RWD case studies, set up GitHub and CodePen accounts and talked a bit about how HTML is used to structure a website.  

* Grades are up on Blackboard for the Case Study.  Log in to [Blackboard](http://learn.kent.edu), go to the Responsive Web Design course and then select Grades.
* We briefly hit on how HTML defines your content structure by using simple elements like Paragraph (P) and Headings (H) to define the structure and hierarchy of a web page.
* Remember your CodePen ([www.codepen.io](http://www.codepen.io)) and GitHub ([www.github.com](http://www.github.com)) login information.  You'll need it for the remaining assignments in the class.

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

Looking ahead to Week 3, we will be learning even more HTML and the principles behind responsive web design, research tactics for web design, setting up the first addition to your GitHub repository and beginning your semester web projects with your group members.

Look for your group members on Monday in the Groups section of the website.  I'm still waiting on a few people's survey submissions before I can get the final groups together.

### HTML Basics 1

HTML Basics 1 is due by the start of class.  You'll complete this assignment using CodePen and then submit the URL to me using Blackboard Learn.  

Submitting assignments is easy - just log in to [Blackboard](http://learn.kent.edu), select the Responsive Web Design class, select Assignments and then select the assignment you're working on.  You'll paste the URLs into the text submission box, and then Submit the assignment.

Remember, I'm grading strictly on the structure of your HTML in this assignment - don't worry about how it looks or functions yet.  That's coming soon.  Please pay attention to your HTML tags to ensure everything is structured correctly!
