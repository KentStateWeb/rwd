title: Week 13 Preview - Style Guides, Pattern Libraries and In-Class Testing
category: blog
---

For the next class, we'll conduct some in-class usability testing on your prototypes.

We'll also talk about how you can document your website through style guides and pattern libraries.  We'll briefly discuss how your website prototype and content might be integrated into a content management system.

In the last class, we:

* Discussed usability tasks and how to test them
* Talked about the importance of web accessibility
* Learned how you can test for performance and also for device/browser compatability
* Continued work on our HTML/CSS prototypes

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

Remember, if you still owe me a CodePen assignment, please get it in ASAP to receive partial credit.

### Performance & Usability Testing

You'll put together a testing plan to ensure your website is usable and works well on multiple devices.  We'll conduct the actual testing in class on Nov. 24.  Remember that your prototype needs to be in working condition (on both mobile and desktop) in order to conduct the testing!
