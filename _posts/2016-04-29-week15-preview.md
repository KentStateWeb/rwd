Tuesday is our last class before your final prototypes and pattern libraries are due!

During the <a href="http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/timeline-presentation/">review sessions</a> on finals week, you'll show the class the process of how you arrived at your final prototypes and get critiques from the class.  We'll also be visited by Dean of the College of Communication and Information, Amy Reynolds, who is excited to observe the sharing sessions.


In the last class, we:

* Completed usability, accessibility and technical testing
* Worked on our group assignments
* Quickly went over a few additional CSS properties, responsive emails and printer style sheets

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## Tuesday's Class

For Tuesday's class, we'll be going over a few final points on Responsive Web Design, and then we'll be spending the majority of the class working on the group projects.  I'll also review the process you should follow for next week's sessions.

Your assignments are due on Tuesday, May 10, which is also the date of the final class (starting at 5:30, our normal time).  You should be working outside of class on your responsive <a href="http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/templates">HTML/CSS Templates</a>, <a href="http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/styleguide">Pattern Library</a> and <a href="http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/timeline-presentation">Project Timeline/Review Presentation</a>.

## Special Guest: Liz Yokum

Joining us for our last formal class will be Liz Yokum.  She is a Kent State University graduate and has worked as a multimedia developer, web presence analyst, web design freelancer, brand manager and most recently, has started her own business.  Liz will be speaking shortly on her background as a front-end web designer and will also be giving your feedback/help on your final projects as you work.  I'm really thrilled Liz could take the time to join us!
