title: Class Tonight + No Office Hours on Nov. 24
category: blog
---

All - just a reminder that we'll be conducting usability testing during class today, as well as continuing to work on the prototype projects.  I'll also give a short lecture on style guides and content management systems.  

Please be prepared with your [testing plans](http://www.rwdkent.com/class/assignments/testing/) and be ready to test your websites at the start of class.  Remember to coordinate with your group members, so that you have the website at least partially ready for your testing tasks.  The testing project is worth 10 points.  

**I won't be available for office hours** prior to class today.  I have a meeting at the Student Center until 5:00, so I won't be back in the office until 5:30.  I'm available to help you out during or after class tonight, if needed.

See you soon!
