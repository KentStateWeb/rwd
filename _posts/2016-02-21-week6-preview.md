Sorry for the late email this week!  I am just getting over a cold and was out of the office on Friday.  

In the next class we go from content strategy to design patterns, styles and an introduction to CSS. 

In the last class, we:

* Reviewed the HTML Basics 2 assignment and talked about our website content
* Talked about and watched a video on Mobile First Design
* Discussed sketching and started our initial website sketches

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

It's time to start covering some visual design concepts!  We'll be jumping into Design Patterns, Style Tiles and Web Typography.  We'll be talking about a few new tools, Sketch and TypeCast, and also starting an introduction to CSS with your first CSS assignment. 

### Project Sketches

This group assignment is due by the start of class.  You should have already started your sketches during the last class.  You'll be producing a minimum of 3 template sketches, snapping photos from your phone and uploading them to your GitHub project repositories.  As usual, you'll have a few minutes at the start of class to get your assignment turned in.  

Don't forget to submit your URLs to Blackboard as well so I can grade them.

### Reading

There are a few assigned readings for class.  Remember that participation is part of your final grade, so it's important to read and be prepared to discuss these in every class.
