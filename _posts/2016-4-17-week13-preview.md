For the next class, we'll also talk about how you can document your website through style guides and pattern libraries.  We'll briefly discuss how your website prototype and content might be integrated into a content management system.

In the last class, we:

* Discussed usability tasks and how to test them
* Talked about the importance of web accessibility
* Learned how you can test for performance and also for device/browser compatability
* Started work on our HTML/CSS prototypes
* Heard from Chris Coyier

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

Hey, there aren't any assignments due for class!  However, I would recommend starting work on the two upcoming assignments:

### Performance & Usability Testing

You'll put together a testing plan to ensure your website is usable and works well on multiple devices.  We'll conduct the actual testing in class on April 26, and you'll turn in the assignment after that.  Remember that your prototype needs to be in working condition (on both mobile and desktop) in order to conduct the testing!

### HTML/CSS Prototypes/Templates Assignment

These are the final prototypes for three main templates for your websites.  They will include the full visual elements from your mockups and style tiles, also include functioning HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
