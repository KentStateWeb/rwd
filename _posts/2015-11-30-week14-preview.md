title: Week 14 Preview - Finalizing Prototypes and Pattern Library + Special Guest Speaker
category: blog
---

We're nearly finished with the semester!  In the next class, we'll work on finalizing your HTML/CSS Prototypes, prepare your pattern libraries and have a special guest.  

This will all lead up to your <a href="http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/timeline-presentation/">review sessions</a> next week (Dec. 8), during which you'll show the class the process of how you arrived at your final prototypes and get critiques from the class.

In the last class, we:

* Conducted in-class usability, accessibility and technical testing
* Discussed pattern libraries and style guides
* Reviewed how your static websites might be integrated into a dynamic content management system

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

There are no specific assignments due for the next class.  However, you should be hard at work outside of class on your responsive <a href="http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/templates">HTML/CSS Templates</a>, <a href="http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/styleguide">Pattern Library</a> and <a href="http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/timeline-presentation">Project Timeline/Review Presentation</a>.

### Special Guest Speaker: Ethan Marcotte

Ethan Marcotte, author of ***Responsive Web Design***, will join us for half an hour via Skype starting at 6 p.m.  Please bring one question for Ethan.  Your question might revolve around your experience building responsive designs so far, his feedback on how to continue learning web design or where he thinks the web design industry might go in the future.
