This week, I'd like to get your feedback.  Since we're about half-way through the semester, the mid-semester survey will help me determine how things are going and where I can improve.  

<a class="button" href="http://rwdkent.com/class/survey/">Take the 5-Minute RWD Survey</a>

Your participation is completely anonymous and optional, but I hope that everyone will <a href="http://rwdkent.com/class/survey/">take the 5 minutes to respond</a>.  

In the last class, we:

* Reviewed CSS properties including color, text, lists, tables and forms
* Reviewed and turned in the CSS Basics assignment
* Talked about how we read, and the importance of balancing line length and font size
* Started on Style Tiles for our projects

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

We'll be having a group discussion about your style tiles (the first part of this assignment is due at the start of class)!  We'll also continue learning some new CSS properties, including CSS boxes, layout and images.

### Style Tiles

This is a group assignment that we started in class.  For the first part of the assignment, you'll be producing two variations of your site's visual language using Style Tiles in Sketch.  

In class, you'll share and explain your thought process.  I'll ask a few questions, on behalf of the client.  Remember, the show-and-tell is also part of your Style Tiles grade, so be sure to think about how you'll respond.  I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with!

Your final Style Tiles assignment isn't due in Blackboard until March 15, along with a single mockup, based on the feedback you hear in class.

### Reading

There are a few assigned readings for class.  The CSS reading this week is going to be essential for learning media queries next week, so be sure that you read and understand it.
