title: Launching the RWD Kent State Website
---

It's finally here - the RWD Kent State class and workshop website.  

I've spent the summer planning, designing and developing a website to accompany my RWD classes.  I felt this website would be important because:

1. It allows me to publicly share what our class is doing with other universities and institutions.
2. It will allow me to promote the class and workshop to future participants.
3. It allowed me to test-run the design/development process that I'll be using in class this fall.
4. It is another way for students to stay engaged in the class and course materials (in addition to Blackboard Learn)

## Building the Website

Because I'm going to run the RWD class using GitHub and Jekyll, I wanted to dogfood this process first-hand.  The site is statically generated on my local computer using Jekyll, and then pushed via Git to GitHub pages, which also allows me to host the site for free.  Jekyll also includes built-in blogging functionality -- which was an added bonus.  

A few techniques I used in the site planning process were:

* Goals & User Stories
* Competitive Analysis
* [Style Tiles in Sketch](/files/RWD-Style-Tiles.pdf)
* Sketching
* [Type Comparisons using TypeCast](/files/type.png)
* [Content Wireframing in HTML](/content)
* [Pattern Library](/patterns)

You can view a few of these rough deliverables using the links above.  I hope that by sharing these deliverables, I can show that the design process is messy and changes as the site is built in the browser.

## The Future

I'll continue updating the website with class information as it's developed.  I'll also be posting recaps of our classes throughout the semester.
