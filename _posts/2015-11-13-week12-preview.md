---

In the next class, we'll talk about how to test your websites for optimal usability and accessibility, while ensuring the websites work well on as many devices as possible.

In the last class, we:

* Discussed building for performance and fast load times
* Integrating JavaScript (including slideshows) into a website
* Building for Progressive Enhancement
* Turning your designs into full-scale templates and prototypes

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

There aren't any assignments due for next week.  However, you do need to begin working on and thinking about the following two assignments as a group. You chose a group lead for each of these assignments in the last class.  

Remember, if you still owe me a CodePen assignment, please get it in ASAP to receive partial credit.

### Performance & Usability Testing

You'll put together a testing plan to ensure your website is usable and works well on multiple devices.  We'll conduct the actual testing in class on Nov. 24.

### HTML/CSS Templates/Prototype

These are the final website templates (a minimum of 3).  You'll use these templates for usability testing in class (they do not need to be final) and show them during the last class.

## News and Announcements

Ethan Marcotte, author of Responsive Web Design, will join us for a short Q&A during class on Dec. 1.  Be sure to think of some questions to ask him!  I will give a bonus point for each high-quality question asked during this class.
