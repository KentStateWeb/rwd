title: Take the RWD Survey + Week Eight Preview

This week, I'd like to get your feedback.  Since we're about half-way through the semester, the mid-semester survey will help me determine how things are going and where I can improve.  

It will also allow the College and I to decide whether or not to offer this class (or similar classes) in the future.  

<a class="button" href="http://rwdkent.com/class/survey/">Take the 5-Minute RWD Survey</a>

Your participation is completely anonymous and optional, but I hope that everyone will <a href="http://rwdkent.com/class/survey/">take the 5 minutes to respond</a>.  

In the last class, we:

* Reviewed CSS properties including color, text, lists, tables and forms
* Talked about how we read, and the importance of balancing line length and font size
* Had Shawn and Jon visit from Nasnadny + Schwartz to talk about their experience working in the web design field
* Started on Style Tiles for our projects

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

We'll be having a group discussion about your style tiles (which are due at the start of class)!  We'll also continue learning some new CSS properties, including CSS boxes, layout and images.  Finally, if time, we'll wrap up the Mobile-First book.

### Style Tiles

This is a group assignment that we started in class.  You'll be producing two variations of your site's visual language using Style Tiles in Sketch.  You should output your tiles as PDF files and upload them to your project repository on GitHub.  

In class, you'll share and explain your thought process.  I'll ask a few questions, on behalf of the client.  Remember, the show-and-tell is also part of your Style Tiles grade, so be sure to think about how you'll respond.  I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with!

### Reading

There are a few assigned readings for class.  The CSS reading this week is going to be essential for learning media queries next week, so be sure that you read and understand it.  

* HTML & CSS Book:  Ch. 13 Boxes, Ch. 15 Layout, Ch. 16 Images
* Mobile First Book: Ch. 7 Layout
* In class: we'll watch a video on the CSS Box Model


## Upcoming Assignments

During the next class we'll start on the next CSS Basics assignment.  You'll be taking your existing Welcome Weekend website and adding CSS.  We'll get started in class.


## News and Announcements

Be sure you're contributing to your group projects equally!  Remember that your team members will be evaluating your performance on the project.  Most importantly, the more you contribute, the more you'll learn.  If you need my input on any group project woes, let me know.
