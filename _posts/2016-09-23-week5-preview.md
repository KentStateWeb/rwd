title: Week Five Preview - Sketching and Mobile First
category: blog
---

The last class was all about content.  In the next class, we'll get into how to structure that content using the mobile-first and sketching.  

In the last class, we discussed:

* Our competitive research assignment + turned in the assignment using GitHub
* How to prioritize and write good content
* HTML images, tables, forms and other HTML elements

We did not have time to watch Karen McGrane's "Mobile Content Mandate" video about the importance of making content viewable on all devices but if you're interested, it's [viewable online](https://vimeo.com/83862998) along with the [slides](https://karenmcgrane.com/2014/01/13/the-mobile-content-mandate/).

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

We'll be discussing the mobile-first and sketching readings, as well as your two latest assignments, HTML Basics 2 and Content/Architecture.  We'll do some hands-on sketching, so be sure to bring some a notebook or sketchbook.

### HTML Basics 2

This is an individual assignment and very similar to your first CodePen exercise.  This time, we'll be adding some new elements like figures, iframes, images and tables.  The assignment is due in CodePen and Blackboard Learn at the start of class.

### Content & Architecture

This is a continuation of your group project assignments.  For this piece, you'll be examining the content your "client" provided and editing/organizing it within Google Drive.  You'll then add the link to your content to your project repository in GitHub and submit the link to me via Blackboard (as a group).

You'll have about 10 minutes to turn this in via GitHub at the beginning of class, so don't worry too much if you're having trouble submitting your link (unless you like the challenge!).

### Reading

There are two assigned readings for class.

* [Sketching - the Visual Thinking Power Tool by Mike Rohde](http://alistapart.com/article/sketching-the-visual-thinking-power-tool)
* [Mobile First - Luke Wroblewski](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933)


## Extras

Get out of your comfort zone!  If you don't normally write well, volunteer to do more writing for your group projects.  If you're still uncomfortable in HTML, write the code while your partner coaches you.  This class is your chance to learn some new skills without the pressure of a real client or boss.
