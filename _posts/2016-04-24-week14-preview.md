We're nearly finished with the semester!  In the next class we'll conduct usability, accessibility and techincal testing based on the testing plans you've developed.

We'll also briefly go over a few last remaining responsive design items.  

This will all lead up to your <a href="http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/timeline-presentation/">review sessions</a> on finals week, during which you'll show the class the process of how you arrived at your final prototypes.  You'll have some time to work on the prototypes in class as well.

In the last class, we:

* Worked on plans for in-class usability, accessibility and technical testing
* Discussed pattern libraries and style guides
* Reviewed how your static websites might be integrated into a dynamic content management system

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

### Performance & Usability Testing

Based on the plan you put together, we'll conduct testing in class, and you'll turn in the assignment on Blackboard and your Project Hub after that.  Remember that your prototype needs to be in working condition in order to conduct the testing tasks you've selected, but it does not need to be finished or look perfect by any means.

### Pizza

I'll be ordering some pizzas to eat while you work - so come hungry!

### Reading

There is one assigned reading that we'll be going over in class:

* [How Much Does a Responsive Design Cost?](http://bradfrost.com/blog/web/how-much-does-a-responsive-web-design-cost/)

## News and Announcements

We'll be completing the standard university class survey of instruction in class this week.
