title: Week 15 Preview - Final Group Working Sessions
category: blog
---

Tonight is our last class before your final websites and pattern libraries are due!

We decided last week that we'll be modifying the due date for the final assignments to **Dec. 15**.  During the <a href="http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/timeline-presentation/">review sessions</a> next week, you'll show the class the process of how you arrived at your final prototypes and get critiques from the class.

In the last class, we:

* Worked on our group assignments
* Heard from our guest speaker, Ethan Marcotte

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## Tonight's Class

In tonight's class, we'll be going over a few final points on Responsive Web Design, and then we'll be spending the majority of the class working on the group projects.  I'll also review the process you should follow for next week's sessions.

Your assignments are due on Tuesday, Dec. 15, which is also the date of the final class (starting at 5:30, our normal time).  You should be working outside of class on your responsive <a href="http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/templates">HTML/CSS Templates</a>, <a href="http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/styleguide">Pattern Library</a> and <a href="http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/timeline-presentation">Project Timeline/Review Presentation</a>.

## Upcoming Assignments

In place of a final exam, you'll be completing a <a href="http://rwdkent.com/class/assignments/assessment">Self/Group Assessment survey</a>, during which you'll review the performance of yourself and your partner during your responsive design project.  This assignment will be due on Dec. 18, the last day of finals week.  The survey is now online for you to see.

## News and Announcements

Please check your grades in Blackboard Learn.  All grades/assignments up to this point should be reflected in Blackboard - so let me know if you see something that's off.
