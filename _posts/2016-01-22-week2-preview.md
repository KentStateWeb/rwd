Thank you all for a great first class!   I think this is going to be an awesome semester.

You'll remember that during the first class we:

* Introduced ourselves
* Went over the syllabus and course schedule
* Talked about Responsive Design and why it's important
* Learned about the history of web design and watched a video on Jeffery Zeldman
* Ate a lot of popcorn

Looking ahead to Week 2, we will be diving into HTML, the building blocks of the web, using CodePen and exploring GitHub, a cloud-based community for hosting your web projects.

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

### Introductory Survey

Take this quick survey before the start of the next class so that (a) I can get to know you better and (b) I can put you into more logical groups for your projects.

### RWD Case Study

Your first mini-assignment, the RWD Case Study, will be due at the beginning of class. There is nothing to turn in for this assignment - it will be a 5-minute discussion with the class (although you may want to make a few notes for yourself).

### Reading

There are 4 assigned, short readings for class.  Completing the assigned reading will allow you participate in class discussions and also be prepared for our hands-on assignments.  Remember that there may be a random (1 point) quiz on the readings during any class.

* HTML&CSS Book - Introduction, Ch. 1 Structure, Ch.2 Text, Ch. 18 Process & Design (out of order)
