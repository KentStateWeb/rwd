Let your interested friends know that the RWD class will be held at the same time and place for Fall 2016!

* Tuesdays from 5:30 - 8: 15 p.m. at IdeaBase
* Both undergraduate and graduate sections  
* Permission from the student's advisor is required in order to register for the course

Please <a href="http://www.rwdkent.com">send those interested to the RWD website</a> or have them contact me with any questions about the course.

Many programs will substitute this class as one of the required program electives.

## Last Week

In the last class we:

* Had an in-class show-and-tell for your Style Tiles
* Covered CSS boxes, layouts and images
* Got started on the CSS Basics 2 assignment

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

We'll be putting together everything we've learned and covering HTML and CSS responsive layouts and media queries.  We'll also discuss the atomic design methodology.  Finally, we'll get started on the mini-assignment, CSS Layout/Media Queries.  

### Guest Speaker: Tyler Clark

Tyler Clark is a consultant, writer and frequent speaker on business technology and digital marketing.  He most recently worked as Senior Digital Architect for Hitchcock Fleming & Associates, and he was previously an Interactive Designer/Developer for Kent State University and managed his own web consulting firm.  

Tyler will join us for a half hour to speak and answer questions about his extensive experience working on websites with teams from a variety of industries.


### CSS Basics 2

This is the individual CodePen assignment that we started in class.  In it, you're applying CSS styles as well as HTML5 elements to your pre-existing Welcome Weekend website.  You'll be using the whole family of CSS attributes to make this happen.  Submit the assignment like normal via Blackboard.

Because this is likely the most challenging mini-assignment yet, I will give you some time to finish it up at the beginning of class.  Please come see me if you'd like any additional help!
