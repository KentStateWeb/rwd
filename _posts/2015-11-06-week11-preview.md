In the next class, we'll talk about advanced web tools, like preprocessors, static site generators and JavaScript/JQuery and how these can be integrated while keeping performance in mind.

In the last class, we:

* Discussed responsive images and SVG
* Looked at CSS animations
* Did some hands-on wireframing in HTML
* Worked on our final CodePen assignments

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

### Layout/Media Queries Assignment

Remember that I've pushed back the due date on this assignment to Tuesday, Nov. 10.  The assignment will be due at the beginning of class.  Please come in and work with me on Monday or Tuesday if you need any additional help.

### HTML Content Wireframes

In this assignment, you'll be creating interactive wireframes to show the content and layout elements of your website prototypes in the browser.  Remember, these don't have to look pretty just yet!

This is part of your group project, and it's due at the start of class on the 10th.  You'll have a few minutes to update your group repositories and get it turned in.

You'll continue working on your web prototype for your projects, as well as putting together a usability testing plan for your website.  We'll do testing on your in-progress prototypes in class on Nov. 24.  

## News and Announcements

In class, you'll come up with a group project management plan for the rest of the semester.  It's important that everyone is contributing to your projects and that you have a good understanding of who's doing what.  This will help you get finished sooner and more efficiently.
