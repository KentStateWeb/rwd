title: Welcome to Responsive Web Design - Spring 2017
category: blog
---
I just wanted to send a quick note and introduce myself - my name is Chris, and I'll be your instructor for the Fall 2016 Responsive Web Design class.

* The class meets on Tuesday evenings from 5:30 - 8:15 p.m.
* The class is held at IdeaBase in Downtown Kent.
* The first class is on ###.

While we all don't like saying goodbye to winter break, I think we're going to really enjoy our semester together.  Much of the class will be discussion-based and hands-on, and by the end of our time together, you’ll have developed a good understanding of web design that you can use forever.

There are very few classes like this being taught right now in higher education, so things will definitely evolve as we go through the class, and I’ll rely on your feedback to know how things are going.

## Things You Need

If you would like to get a head start, there are 2 required textbooks for the course.  We will discuss these in detail during the first class, and you are not expected to have them the first day.

One provides detailed examples and instructions for HTML/CSS, and the other provides more practical knowledge on responsive web design specifically.  They’re easy to read and inexpensive.

1. [HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett](http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189), November 2011, Wiley. ($16.68 on Amazon)
2. [Responsive Web Design by Ethan Marcotte](http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design), Second Edition, December 2014, A Book Apart. ($9.00/Ebook or $18.00/Paperback)

If you're eager to get started learning, you can start exploring articles posted on the [class website](http://www.rwdkent.com), or visit some of these resources that we'll be using later on.  There's no up front knowledge needed prior to class.

## Course Website and Blackboard Learn

While this is a face-to-face class, this course will rely heavily on the class website and Blackboard Learn.  The course blog, syllabus, schedule, assignments, readings and more will be available on the website.

Visit the course website at [www.rwdkent.com](http://www.rwdkent.com).  You can also follow the class on [Twitter - @rwdkent](http://www.twitter.com/rwdkent).

Blackboard Learn will only be used for turning in assignments and keeping track of grades.  You can log in to Learn by visiting [http://learn.kent.edu](http://learn.kent.edu) or via FlashLine by clicking on the Learn icon.

## Getting to IdeaBase

IdeaBase is a student-powered design agency that’s run through the College of Communication & Information in Downtown Kent.  It’s the perfect place for this type of class, but it may not be on your normal campus route.  IdeaBase is located in Acorn Alley at 138 E. Main Street, Suite 203 on the second floor above 4 Cats Art Studio and Flashers Cleaners.  Visit the [directions on the IdeaBase website](http://ideabasekent.com/directions) to get more detailed directions and parking information.  

You can of course walk or bike to class along the esplanade, but if you’re driving, you can park for FREE in any of the public or metered spots on Main Street after 5:00 p.m.  Plus, you have access to all of the amenities that downtown Kent has to offer before and after class and on breaks.

That's all for now.  If you have any questions about this course, please feel free to email me or bring them for the first class.  Looking forward to meeting you!

Chris H.
