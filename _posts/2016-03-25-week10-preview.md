title: Week 10 Preview - Responsive Images and HTML Wireframing
category: blog
published: true
---

Hope you are all having a great spring break!  Next week, we'll continue practicing with CSS Media Queries in class and cover atomic design (which we didn't get to last time).  We'll also be talking more about how images can be made to be more responsive, and we'll start wireframing your project assignments in HTML.

In the last class, we:

* Introduced media queries and how they contribute to flexible designs
* Reviewed how HTML 5 elements can bring more semantic meaning to websites
* Started on the layout/media query assignment
* Heard from Tyler Clark about web development in the real world

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

### Layout/Media Queries Assignment

In this assignment, you're going to create some of your first media queries and apply them to the Welcome Weekend website that you already created.  If you need a refresher on how media queries work, please see last week's slides or the Responsive Web Design book.  Media queries aren't covered in the HTML+CSS book.
