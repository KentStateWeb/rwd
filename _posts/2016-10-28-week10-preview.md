title: Week 10 Preview - Atomic Design, HTML Wireframing + Special Guests
category: blog
published: true
---

Next week, we'll continue practicing with CSS Media Queries in class and cover atomic design.  We'll also start wireframing your project assignments in HTML and get a visit from a special guest.

In the last class, we:

* Introduced media queries and how they contribute to flexible designs
* Reviewed how HTML 5 elements can bring more semantic meaning to websites
* Started on the layout/media query assignment

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

### Special Guests: ipsoCreative

ipsoCreative is a boutique web agency and custom web development firm based in Akron.  Joshua Mitchell, Partner and Creative Director, and members of his team will visit to tell us how their company's web design process works and show some of their recent work.  Be sure to ask questions for bonus points!

### Fonts & Media Queries Assignment

In this assignment, you're going to create some of your first media queries and apply them to the Welcome Weekend website that you already created.  If you need a refresher on how media queries work, please see last week's slides or the Responsive Web Design book.  Media queries aren't covered in the HTML+CSS book.  This will likely be the most difficult CodePen exercise yet - so I'll answer questions at the beginning of the next class.
