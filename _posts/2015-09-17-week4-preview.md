title: Week Four Preview - Content-First Design and HTML
category: blog
---

In the last class, we really got rolling by completing our first HTML assignment, setting up our GitHub repositories and discussing research in the web design process.

* We reviewed the HTML list and link elements from the HTML book
* Talked about how we identify our user's needs by identifying top tasks and using various research techniques
* Introduced our semester projects and groups
* Reviewed the first project assignment, the Competitive Analysis
* Set up GitHub, the place where our project files will live
* We briefly used SublimeText for editing HTML and GitHub Desktop, a utility for getting your files from your computer to the GitHub cloud.  I added a post discussing [HTML text editors that you can install on your personal computer](ttp://rwdkent.com/blog/2015/09/17/week4-preview.html).

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

We'll begin discussing content and how it fits into the web design process (hint - it's one of the most important pieces).  We'll also review the last parts of HTML, including images, tables forms and other markup.  In class, we'll watch an awesome talk from Karen McGrane called the "Mobile Content Mandate".  I'll bring coffee and pastries from Tree City.

### Research/Competitive Analysis

This is the first part of your semester-long project.  I have this set up as a group assignment submission in Blackboard.  That means only one person needs to "submit" the assignment.  You'll see that when you submit the assignment, you'll submit it for your entire group, rather than just yourself.  When I grade the assignment, all of the group members get the same grade.

For this assignment, you're going to create a PDF document reporting on your project research.  Once the PDF is compiled, you'll then place the PDF into your GitHub directory in a folder called "research" and sync your files so that they are uploaded to the internet.

For groups that are having trouble (since you are new to GitHub), I will allow you to do the GitHub part at the very beginning of class (no more than 10 minutes).  However, you must have the PDF finalized before then.  You won't have time to work on the research PDF in class.
