In the next class, we'll talk about how to test your websites for optimal usability and accessibility, while ensuring the websites work well on as many devices as possible.

In the last class, we:

* Discussed building for performance and progressive enhancement
* Integrating JavaScript into a website
* Worked on your HTML wireframes

Remember that you can access common RWD patterns and code samples on the RWD website at [http://www.rwdkent.com/common-patterns](http://www.rwdkent.com/common-patterns).

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

There are two assignments due this week - HTML Content Wireframes (group) and Boxes and Layout (individual).


### HTML Content Wireframes

Your HTML content wireframes are due at the beginning of class.  I'll ask a few groups to demo their wireframes for the class.  Remember, you only need to create 3 representative wireframes at a minimum and they do not need to include colors, typography or layout styles, beyond those provided as sample code.

### Boxes and Layout

This is your final CodePen assignment and it is all about laying out elements using flexbox.  This assignment will be challenging, so be sure to give yourself extra time for questions.

### Extras

We'll be turning attention from the practical lessons to more hands-on project work in the coming weeks.  Be sure to work with your project partner to develop a meeting schedule as project work starts to increase prior to finals week.  

Looking forward to seeing your website prototypes start to come together!  See you on Tuesday.
