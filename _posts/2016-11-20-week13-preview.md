For the next class, we'll talk about how you can document your website through style guides and pattern libraries.  

We'll briefly discuss how your website prototype and content might be integrated into a content management system.

In the last class, we:

* Discussed usability tasks and how to test them
* Talked about the importance of web accessibility
* Learned how you can test for performance and also for device/browser compatibility
* Continued work on our HTML Wireframes
* Finished the Boxes and Layout Assignment

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

As long as you've turned in everything due thus far, there aren't any assignments due for class!  However, it's important that you start work on the two upcoming assignments:

### Performance & Usability Testing

You'll put together a testing plan to ensure your website is usable and works well on multiple devices.  We'll conduct the actual testing in class on November 29, and you'll turn in the assignment after that.  Remember that your prototype needs to be in working condition (on both mobile and desktop) in order to conduct the testing!

### HTML/CSS Prototypes/Templates Assignment

These are the final prototypes for three main templates for your websites.  They will include the full visual elements from your mockups and style tiles, and also include functioning HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

### Special Guest: Brad Frost

Brad Frost is a web designer, speaker, consultant, musician, and artist from Pittsburgh, PA.  He's worked on responsive web implementation for businesses that include TechCrunch, Entertainment Weekly, Verizon and Nike, and he's also the creator of [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io) and [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com) (soon to be published as a book).  Brad will join us for about 30 minutes via Skype.  Bring your questions (for a bonus point), especially regarding responsive design process and design systems.

### Reading

There are a few assigned readings for class:

* [Getting Started with Pattern Libraries by Anna Debenham](http://alistapart.com/blog/post/getting-started-with-pattern-libraries)
* [Style Guide Best Practices by Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/style-guide-best-practices/)

## Extras

Sometimes when you and your partner edit the same exact line of code on your projects, you'll get a "merge conflict" error.  We'll talk more about this in class, but this article describes [merge conflicts in better detail](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/advanced-topics/merge-conflicts).
