Happy Friday!  Here's a recap of the last class, as well as what's up for the Class 4: Content-First Design.

In the last class, we:

* We reviewed the HTML list and link elements from the HTML book
* Talked about how we identify our user's needs by identifying top tasks and using various research techniques
* Introduced our semester projects and groups
* Reviewed the first project assignment, Research/Competitive Analysis
* Set up GitHub and GitHub Pages, the place where our project files and websites will live
* We briefly used Atom for editing HTML and GitHub Desktop, a utility for getting your files from your computer to the GitHub cloud.  I added a post discussing [HTML text editors that you can install on your personal computer](http://rwdkent.com/blog/2015/09/17/week4-preview.html).

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

## For Next Class

We'll begin discussing content and how it fits into the web design process.  We'll also review the last parts of HTML, including images, tables forms and other markup.  In class, we'll watch an awesome talk from Karen McGrane called the "Mobile Content Mandate".

### Research/Competitive Analysis

This is the first part of your semester-long project.  You're going to create a PDF document reporting on your project research (see assignment for details).  Once the PDF is compiled, you'll then place the PDF into your GitHub directory in a folder called "research" and sync your files so that they are uploaded to the internet.

I have this set up as a group assignment submission in Blackboard, for those working in groups.  That means only one person from a group needs to "submit" the assignment.   When I grade the assignment, all of the group members get the same grade at once.

We'll do the GitHub/Blackboard submission part at the very beginning of class, so don't worry about this part for now.  However, you must have the PDF finalized before then.  You won't have time to work on the research PDF in class.
