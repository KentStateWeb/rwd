title: Week 9 Preview - Media Queries and Layout

This week we'll be putting together everything we've learned and covering HTML and CSS responsive layouts and media queries.

In the last class we:

* Had an in-class show-and-tell for your Style Tiles
* Covered CSS boxes, layouts and images
* Got started on the CSS Basics 2 assignment

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

### CSS Basics 2

This is the individual CodePen assignment that we started in class.  In it, you're applying CSS styles as well as HTML5 elements to your pre-existing Welcome Weekend website.  You'll be using the whole family of CSS attributes to make this happen.  Submit the assignment like normal via Blackboard.

Because this is likely the most challenging mini-assignment yet, I will give you some time to finish it up at the beginning of class.  Please come see me if you'd like any additional help!

### Style Tiles/Mockups

Just a reminder - if you haven't yet turned the Style Tiles/Mockup assignment in on Blackboard, please be sure to submit it soon.

### Reading

There are a few assigned readings for class.  If nothing else, you should definitely be familiar with the reading from the Responsive Web Design book which cover the basics of CSS media queries that we'll use for the rest of the semester.

* HTML&CSS - Ch. 17 HTML5 Layout (this finishes the book)
* Responsive Web Design (yellow book) - Ch. 2 The Flexible Grid, Ch. 3 Flexible Images, Ch. 4 Media Queries
