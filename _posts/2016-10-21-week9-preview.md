This week we'll be putting together everything we've learned and covering HTML and CSS responsive layouts and media queries.

In the last class we:

* Had an in-class show-and-tell for your Style Tiles
* Covered CSS boxes, layouts and images

You can find the slides from each class under the [Class Schedule](http://rwdkent.com/class/schedule/) section of the website.

### CSS Basics 2

This is the individual CodePen assignment that I briefly explained in class.  In it, you're applying CSS styles as well as HTML5 elements (see chapter 17 in HTML&CSS) to your pre-existing Welcome Weekend website.  You'll be using the whole family of CSS attributes to make this happen.  Submit the assignment like normal via Blackboard.

Because this is likely the most challenging mini-assignment yet, I will give you some time to finish it up at the beginning of class.  Please come see me if you'd like any additional help!

### Style Tiles/Mockups

Based on your style tiles feedback from the class and the “client”, create one mock-up that shows your style tiles in use. You might create a small screen and a large screen to show the 2 extremes of your design in use.

Combine your mockups with your style tiles into a single PDF file and be ready to submit your PDF file as part of your GitHub repository on your project hub page.

### Reading

There are a few assigned readings for class.  If nothing else, you should definitely be familiar with the reading from the Responsive Web Design book which cover the basics of CSS media queries that we'll use for the rest of the semester.

* HTML&CSS - Ch. 17 HTML5 Layout (this finishes the book)
* Responsive Web Design (yellow book) - Ch. 2 The Flexible Grid, Ch. 3 Flexible Images, Ch. 4 Media Queries
* [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Just skim
