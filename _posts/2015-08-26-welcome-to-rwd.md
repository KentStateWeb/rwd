title: Welcome to Responsive Web Design!

I just wanted to send a quick note to introduce myself - my name is Chris, and I'll be your instructor for the Fall 2015 Responsive Web Design class.  The class meets on Tuesday evenings from 5:30 - 8:15 p.m. at IdeaBase in Downtown Kent.  

***Note: Pardon the SPAM!  You may have received this email twice, but I think you'll agree this (non-Blackboard) version is much more readable.***

While it’s definitely no fun ending our summers and going back to class, I think you’re going to really enjoy this semester together.  Much of the class will be discussion-based and hands-on, and by the end of our time together, you’ll have developed an understanding of web design that you’ll be able to use forever.  The more you are willing to explore and try things outside your comfort zone, the more you’re going to benefit from the class.

This is also the first (but hopefully not last) time this class is being taught - I designed it this summer from scratch.  In fact, there are very few classes like this being taught in higher education.  Things will definitely evolve as we go through the class, and I’ll rely on your feedback to know how things are going.

## Things You Need:

If you would like to get a jump start, here are the 4 things you'll need for this class.  We will discuss these in detail during the first class, and you are not expected to have them the first day:
* Design notebook: You are expected to obtain a design notebook, or sketchbook, and bring it to class. You will use this to collect ideas, sketch out designs, and capture your design thoughts on paper. You can use something fancy (e.g., a Moleskine) or something cheap (e.g., a composition notebook). Whatever you choose, you are expected to have a design notebook, carry it with you throughout the term, and bring it to class.

There are 3 required textbooks for the course. One provides detailed examples and instructions for HTML/CSS, and the others provide more practical knowledge on web design topics.  They’re easy to read and inexpensive.

1. [HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett](http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189), November 2011, Wiley. ($17.39 on Amazon)
2. [Mobile-First Design by Luke Wroblewski](http://abookapart.com/products/mobile-first), October 2011, A Book Apart. ($9.00/Ebook or $18.00/Paperback)
3. [Responsive Web Design by Ethan Marcotte](http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design), Second Edition, December 2014, A Book Apart. ($9.00/Ebook or $18.00/Paperback)

You will receive 15% off your order of Mobile-First Design and Responsive Web Design if you order both books at once from [A Book Apart](http://abookapart.com).

## Course Website and Blackboard Learn:

While this is a face-to-face class, this course will rely heavily on the class website and Blackboard Learn.  The course blog, syllabus, schedule, assignments, readings and more will be available on the website (which will keep evolving).  By the way, you’ll be able to do most everything you see on this website by the end of the course. 

Visit the course website at [www.rwdkent.com](http://www.rwdkent.com).  You can also follow the class on [Twitter - @rwdkent](http://www.twitter.com/rwdkent).

I have a love-hate relationship with Blackboard Learn, so it will only be used for course announcements, turning in assignments and keeping track of grades, although you can use it to jump to many of the sections of the website.  You can log in to Learn by visiting [http://learn.kent.edu](http://learn.kent.edu) or via FlashLine by clicking on the Learn icon in the upper-right. 

## Getting to IdeaBase:

IdeaBase is a collaborative, student-powered agency that’s run through the College of Communication & Information in Downtown Kent.  It’s the perfect place for this type of class, but it may not be on your normal campus route.  IdeaBase is located in Acorn Alley on the second floor above 4 Cats Art Studio and Flashers Cleaners.  Visit [http://ideabasekent.com/contact-us](http://ideabasekent.com/contact-us) to get more detailed directions.  

You can of course walk or bike to class along the esplanade, but if you’re driving, you can park for FREE in any of the public or metered spots on Main Street after 5:00 p.m.  Plus, you have access to all of the amenities that downtown Kent has to offer before and after class, including [Tree City Coffee](http://www.rootedinkent.com) (my favorite).

That's all for now.  If you have any questions about this course, please feel free to email me or bring them for the first class.  Looking forward to meeting you!

Chris H.
