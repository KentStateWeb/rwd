Our weekly update meeting (virtual Scrum) will be held each week at 4:00 on Tuesdays on Slack for a maximum of 15 minutes.

These virtual meetings will help teams stay up-to-date and create a plan for the rest of the week.  

The team may also decide to take notes in Basecamp or Slack.

## Format

A member of each of the subteams (typically the team lead) will answer the following questions:

1.  What have we done so far that has helped us meet the sprint goal?
2.  What do we plan to do for the rest of the week to help meet the goal?
3.  Do we see any impediments that prevent us from meeting the goal?

Attendance and participation in the virtual scrums will be factored into the attendance grade for the semester.
