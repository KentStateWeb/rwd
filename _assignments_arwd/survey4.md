Welcome to the Sprint Retrospective Survey for Advanced Responsive Web Design.  Please answer these questions honestly.  Your answers will be used to calculate your grade for this sprint.   You didn't have to complete every task perfectly in order to receive full credit.  You just have to be able to thoughtfully explain how your attempted to meet your commitment.

Please be sure to take the survey by the due date (listed above) @ midnight.  Late submissions won't be accepted.

You can see the rubric criteria used for grading below.  The questions in later surveys may change slightly over time based on prior responses.
