Choose a web-design related book and prepare a 10 minute presentation summary on that book/topic.  Book assignments will be spread out throughout the semester, usually coinciding slightly with what weâ€™ll be discussing in class.  

These are individual assignments  Please tell the instructor your choice by the 2nd class.

Books will be provided (either physical or digital copy).  Physical copies are noted, as there is only 1 copy available.

## Presentations must include
A summary of the major topics from the book
Examples from the book as well as from real-life
At least 5 major ideas from the book that would be helpful to our project
Slides and presentation style are up to you
