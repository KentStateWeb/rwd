Graduate students in the class will choose one of the future proposed topics to be taught by the instructor.  After being briefed by the instructor on that topic and the goals that should be covered, the graduate student will essentially teach the class that subject (with help from the instructor as needed).  

Slides, demos and any other supplemental materials that will help student understanding are required.

## Grading

This assignment is worth 10% of the graduate student grade.  If not completed, the 10 points will be deducted from the total grade (it will not show up as a separate assignment in Blackboard).
