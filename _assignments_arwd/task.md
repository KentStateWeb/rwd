While attendance and participation is important, it's also important that you contributed your equal share of work to the final project.  This will be measured in the following ways:

* When a task is assigned to you in Trello, it was completed correctly and on time.
* Your GitHub history shows that you've contributed quality work to the overall project (instructor can see all commits)
* According to your retrospective surveys, you have verbally described the tasks you've completed, as well as any trouble you had along the way.  
* According to your retrospective surveys, you committed an average of 2 hours of work to the project outside of class each week.

## Rubric

**8-10:** Excellent overall task completion and quality.  You were always consistent in getting things done, putting in extra time when needed.

**5-7:** You did an adequate job at completing tasks, but weren't always consistent in getting things done on time or at a professional quality level.  Some improvement is needed.

**0-4:** Many tasks that you were assigned were not completed or weren't completed at a professional level.  Other team members had to finish your assigned work.
