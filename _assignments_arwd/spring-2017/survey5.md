You'll give a short, 5-10 minute individual presentation during our finals week class, in addition to finishing up any remaining sprint items.  

The presentation will cover what you've contributed to the project throughout the semester, your successes, your challenges and what you'd improve upon.  This short presentation should include a visual (slides or website demonstration) to illustrate your main points.

## Components to Include

1.  A summary of the deliverables from all sprints that you directly worked on and contributed to throughout the semester (with any demonstrations or visuals that best present your points).
2.  Components and parts you thought were most successful.
3.  Components that you would like to improve if you had more time.
4.  A discussion of what you've learned throughout the semester.  This could be technical or design items, or general items like project management, team work and client interaction.

You can email any slides to Chris for review following the presentation.

## Grading Rubric

I'll use your presentation to award the Sprint 5 points, as well as determine your overall task completion grade for the semester.

* **11-15 (Very engaged and valuable team member)**: Based on your presentation, you contributed a large amount of quality work to all sprints and learned a lot in the process.  You thoughtfully reflected on what was successful and what needed more work throughout the semester.  Your visual aid clearly demonstrated your points.
* **6-10 (Moderately engaged team member)**: You contributed some work during the sprints, but it may have only been of average quality and you still had important things to learn.  While you completed some tasks, you weren't as engaged with your team as you could have been, and others may have had to pick up some of your tasks.  You reflected on what you could do to improve, but may need to solidify your plan going forward.  Your visuals may have demonstrated some, but not all, of your points.
* **0-5 (Non-engaged team member)**: You contributed minimal work to the sprints of varying quality and did not show what you've learned. Much of the work you presented may have been completed by other team members.  You weren't able to thoughtfully reflect on what was successful or not successful and why. Note: A 0 score will also be given if the presentation is not given during class, even if all other criteria are positive.
