Welcome to the Sprint Retrospective Survey for Advanced Responsive Web Design.  Please answer these questions honestly.  Your answers will be used to calculate your grade for this sprint.   You didn't have to complete every task perfectly in order to receive full credit.  You just have to be able to thoughtfully explain how your attempted to meet your commitment.

Please be sure to take the survey by the due date (listed above) @ midnight.  Late submissions won't be accepted.

You can see the rubric criteria used for grading below.  The questions in later surveys may change slightly over time based on prior responses.

## Rubric

* **11-15 (Very engaged and valuable team member)**: You contributed a large amount of quality work to the previous sprint and learned a lot in the process.  You completed most if not all of your tasks successfully, and if you weren't able to complete something, you notified the team ahead of time so that they didn't negatively affect our sprint goal.  You also participated in most if not all of the virtual Scrum sessions and reflected thoughtfully on what you and your team can do to improve going forward.  
* **6-10 (Moderately engaged team member)**: You contributed some work to the previous sprint, but it may have only been of average quality and you still important things to learn.  While you completed some tasks, you weren't as engaged with your team as you could have been, and others may have had to pick up some of your tasks.  You participated in some of the virtual Scrum sessions.  You reflected on what you could do to improve, but may need to solidify your plan going forward.
* **0-5 (Non-engaged team member)**: You contributed minimal work to the previous sprint of varying quality and did not show what you've learned so far.  Your team had to continually stay on you about completing tasks and contributing.  You may have dropped off communicating for a few days or a week, and perhaps weren't present for any virtual Scrum sessions.  Your reflection on what you can do to improve doesn't reflect attainable goals.  Note: A 0 score will also be given if the survey is not submitted on time, even if all other criteria are positive.
