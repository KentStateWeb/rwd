You'll give a short, 5-10 minute individual presentation during our finals week class, in addition to finishing up any remaining sprint items.  

The presentation will cover what you've contributed to the project throughout the semester, your successes, your challenges and what you'd improve upon.  This short presentation should include a visual (slides or website demonstration) to illustrate your main points.

## Components to Include

1.  A summary of the deliverables from all sprints that you directly worked on and contributed to throughout the semester (with any demonstrations or visuals that best present your points).
2.  Components and parts you thought were most successful.
3.  Components that you would like to improve if you had more time.
4.  A discussion of what you've learned throughout the semester.  This could be technical or design items, or general items like project management, team work and client interaction.

You can email any slides to Chris for review following the presentation.

## Grading Rubric

I'll use your presentation to award the Sprint 5 points, as well as determine your overall task completion grade for the semester.

* **11-15 (Very engaged and valuable team member)**: You contributed a large amount of quality work to the previous sprint and learned a lot in the process.  You completed most if not all of your tasks successfully, and if you weren't able to complete something, you notified the team ahead of time so that they didn't negatively affect our sprint goal.  You also participated in most if not all of the virtual Scrum sessions and reflected thoughtfully on what you and your team can do to improve going forward.  
* **6-10 (Moderately engaged team member)**: You contributed some work to the previous sprint, but it may have only been of average quality and you still important things to learn.  While you completed some tasks, you weren't as engaged with your team as you could have been, and others may have had to pick up some of your tasks.  You participated in some of the virtual Scrum sessions.  You reflected on what you could do to improve, but may need to solidify your plan going forward.
* **0-5 (Non-engaged team member)**: You contributed minimal work to the previous sprint of varying quality and did not show what you've learned so far.  Your team had to continually stay on you about completing tasks and contributing.  You may have dropped off communicating for a few days or a week, and perhaps weren't present for any virtual Scrum sessions.  Your reflection on what you can do to improve doesn't reflect attainable goals.  Note: A 0 score will also be given if the survey is not submitted on time, even if all other criteria are positive.
