## Goals

**What are your top goals as a business this year?**



**What would you like the website to be able to do for your users?**


**Who are some of your top competitors?**

We don't necessarily have competitors, but some surrounding communities have organizations similar to ours.  United Way also provides similar services, although we partner with them.

* Community Services of Stark: http://www.communityservicesofstark.org/index.php



**If you could use a few adjectives to describe your company and desired website, what would they be?**
