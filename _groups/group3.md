## Goals

**What are your top goals as a business this year?**

* Invite new visitors to our clinic for the first time
* Provide better resources and connections with our current clients, perhaps through a blog, social media or original articles
* Set up and promote our new Pet Portal, which allows clients to see their pet's history, request appointments and communicate with our team (part of a separate website that we don't operate).  This portal is very expensive to operate, so we need to make sure people know where to find it and how to use it.

**What would you like the website to be able to do for your users?**

* Make it easy for new visitors to find us, especially on Google, and then get to our office and see office hours.
* Outline the different services we offer, as well as promoting that we're AAHA certified (which is a high level of certification in the vet world).
* Access the Pet portal
* Provide some sort of blog or original articles (for example, care guides) for our patients (as well as for promotion on social channels)
* provide background information on the practice, our staff etc.
* Connect to various social media (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)
