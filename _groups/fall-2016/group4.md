## Goals

**What are your top goals as a business this year?**

* Develop and market some brand new brews, especially for the fall and winter
* Promote attendance at our "Hoppy Hours" and other tasting events
* Offer additional food items, including flatbreads and appetizers
* Promote our growler service, allowing more people to enjoy our brews at home


**What would you like the website to be able to do for your users?**

* First, they need to be able to find our location and hours easily, since visitors are what sustains us as a business
* Allow people to see our different craft brews (maybe sorted by type), which change out seasonally.  This is what keeps people coming back.  Each month we have a featured brew.
* Secondarily, promote that we offer flatbreads and appetizers, which makes us a great first stop on a night out.  
* Talk about our history and importance as a small business in the community
* List upcoming events and tastings - which tends to get people to visit for the first time.
* Allow people to connect with us on social media
