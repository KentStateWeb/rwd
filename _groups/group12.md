## Goals

**What are your top goals as a business this year?**

* Reach new clients (approx 10% more capacity), especially for our supplemental programs like summer camp and after school care.
* Recruit qualified staff members.  We are having trouble recruiting qualified staff and retaining those staff.
* Promote our unique creative curriculum for each grade level
* Increase the number of prospective clients through visits to our center
* Stay better connected with current parents and families


**What would you like the website to be able to do for your users?**

* Outline our program's curriculum.  For example, we offer early education in art, wellness and science.
* Allow people to easily find us and schedule a visit online
* Allow qualified staff members to see new job postings, understand qualifications and easily apply
* Feature photos of our caretakers and kids, as well as testimonials from other parents, showing that we offer a caring and passionate environment
* Provide bios and photos of our staff, as well as their education philosophies
* Post news and announcements to current parents and promote how we're enriching their children's lives

**If you could use a few adjectives to describe your company and desired website, what would they be?**

We're these children's home away from home, and we take that responsibility very seriously.  At the same time, we want to do more than just operate as a daycare - we want to enrich these children's lives from day one so that they can have lifelong success.
